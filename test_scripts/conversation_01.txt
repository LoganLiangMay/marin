Opening: Rep: "Hey Sarah, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now  what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call  it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"
Sarah: "Yeah, absolutely. Always happy to talk shop about what's actually happening in the trenches versus what the platforms tell us should be happening."
Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"
Sarah: "We're a mid-size agency focused exclusively on e-commerce brands, mostly DTC. I oversee a team of six paid media specialists. Day-to-day, I'm jumping between client strategy calls, reviewing campaign performance, approving creative tests, and honestly, way too much time in spreadsheets trying to reconcile data from different platforms."
Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"
Sarah: "Mondays are all about weekly reporting - pulling data from Meta, Google, TikTok, Shopify, our attribution tool. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are campaign optimization days. Thursdays are client calls. Fridays are supposed to be strategic planning but usually turn into firefighting whatever broke during the week. We're also constantly testing new creative - probably launching 20-30 new ad variants per week across all clients."
Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"
Sarah: "TikTok has been crushing it for our younger-skewing brands. We're seeing CPAs 40-50% lower than Meta for some clients. Broad Match on Google has actually gotten better with their AI improvements. And we've finally gotten our creative production process down - we can turn around UGC-style content in 48 hours now."
Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"
Sarah: "Attribution is a nightmare. Every client wants to know true ROAS, but we're working with 5-6 different attribution windows across platforms, plus our MTA tool is giving us different numbers than the platforms, and Google Analytics 4 is... well, it's GA4. iOS 14 killed so much of our retargeting precision. And honestly, the amount of manual work hasn't decreased even though the platforms promise more automation - we're just automating different things while new manual work pops up."
Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"
Sarah: "Three big ones. First, attribution and measurement - we can't confidently tell clients what's actually working anymore. Second, the amount of manual platform hopping. I have team members with literally 15 browser tabs open just to check on campaigns. Third, creative testing at scale - we know testing is critical, but managing hundreds of ad variants across platforms manually is brutal. We're supposed to be strategic, but we're mostly doing data entry and manual QA."
Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating  what happened?"
Sarah: "Just last month, we launched a Black Friday campaign for a supplement brand. We had 60 ad variants across Meta and Google, 12 different audience segments, multiple landing pages. Campaign launched Friday at midnight. By Saturday afternoon, we noticed three ad sets on Meta had burned through 80% of daily budget by 10am because the CPA targets were too loose. But we didn't catch it until we manually checked because our alert system only monitors at account level, not ad set level. We lost probably $8K in wasted spend that weekend. Meanwhile, some Google campaigns weren't spending at all because of some obscure policy flag we didn't see. We basically spent the whole weekend in firefighting mode instead of optimizing for performance."
Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"
Sarah: "Honestly? In the gaps between platforms. Like, a client pauses campaigns in Shopify, but our Meta ads keep running. Or budget pacing issues - we set daily budgets but actual spend is super inconsistent, and we don't find out until end of day. Or creative gets disapproved on one platform but not others, and we don't have a centralized way to know. It's death by a thousand paper cuts."
Rep: "How do you onboard new clients or campaigns? What's that process look like from start to finish?"
Sarah: "It's a 3-4 week process. Week one is audit and strategy - we're manually pulling their historical data, building our tracking infrastructure, setting up our attribution. Week two is campaign buildout - manually creating campaigns in each platform, which is incredibly tedious when you're setting up similar campaigns across Meta, Google, and TikTok. Week three is creative production and QA. Week four is launch and monitoring. But here's the thing - probably 60% of that time is manual data entry and configuration that should be automatable but isn't."
Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"
Sarah: "Way more hands-on than we'd like. We check campaigns at least twice daily, sometimes more during launches or high-spend periods. The platform automation is okay for basic stuff, but it doesn't understand business context. Like, Google's Target CPA bidding doesn't know that our client is running a site-wide sale and we should actually be more aggressive. Or Meta's Advantage+ campaigns don't respect our need to test specific audience hypotheses. So we're constantly intervening manually."
Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"
Sarah: "Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, TikTok Ads Manager, Pinterest obviously. Then we have Triple Whale for some attribution and analytics, Google Analytics 4, Shopify analytics, Supermetrics for pulling data into Google Sheets, Slack for our internal comms, Asana for project management. Some clients use Northbeam or Rockerbox for attribution. And honestly, like six different spreadsheets that different team members built."
Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"
Sarah: "What we love - Meta's creative testing tools are pretty good when they work. Google's responsive search ads actually perform well. TikTok's creative center is genuinely helpful for ideation. What's frustrating - nothing talks to each other. We're copying and pasting between platforms constantly. Reporting is manual. Each platform has its own idiosyncrasies - Meta calls it 'Ad Sets', Google calls it 'Ad Groups', TikTok calls it something else. The learning curve for new team members is massive because they have to learn six different interfaces."
Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"
Sarah: "Creative strategy, audience insights, and business context. Like, platforms can't know that our client is launching a new product line next week and we should be shifting budget. They can't understand brand voice in creative. They definitely can't handle client communication. But honestly, there's also a ton of manual work that should be automated but isn't - like bulk campaign creation, cross-platform budget reallocation, creative variant deployment."
Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or creative testing?"
Sarah: "My team collectively spends probably 40-50 hours per week on reporting alone. That's pulling data, reconciling numbers, building client decks. Creative testing management - uploading variants, tracking performance, analyzing results - is another 20-30 hours per week across the team. So we're talking 60-80 hours per week on stuff that feels like it should be automated."
Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"
Sarah: "Actually think strategically. Dive into customer research. Do competitive analysis. Test new platforms and tactics. Right now, we're so heads-down in execution that we barely have time for innovation. I'd also love to actually do cross-platform analysis - like, what if we could easily see which creative themes work across Meta AND Google AND TikTok? But that's a manual nightmare right now."
Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"
Sarah: "Honestly, it's a mess. We're using last-click attribution for most reporting because it's simplest, but we know it's wrong. We're experimenting with Triple Whale's attribution, but clients are skeptical because the numbers don't match platform reporting. A few of our bigger clients are starting to ask about MMM, but that feels like enterprise-level stuff we can't quite justify yet. The real problem is that we have attribution data, but we don't trust it enough to make big budget decisions based on it."
Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"
Sarah: "Retargeting has gotten way less precise. We used to be able to do really granular retargeting - like, people who viewed this specific product collection but didn't add to cart. Now it's much broader. Our retargeting CPAs have probably gone up 30-40% over the last two years. We're compensating by going heavier on first-party data and really pushing our clients to build their email lists. But it's definitely not as effective as it used to be."
Rep: "Are you experimenting with any first-party data approaches yet?"
Sarah: "Yeah, we're pushing all our clients to implement server-side tracking and build customer match audiences. But it's slow going. Most of our clients are small brands without strong tech teams. Setting up Conversion API for Meta, enhanced conversions for Google - it's technical work that our clients struggle with. And then even when we get it set up, the match rates are lower than we'd like."
Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to data compliance or stakeholder reporting?"
Sarah: "Compliance is honestly more of a 'check the box' thing for us right now - we make sure we have consent banners, we follow platform guidelines. But stakeholder reporting is painful. Clients want simple answers - 'what's my ROAS?' - but the honest answer is 'it depends on which attribution model and time window you use.' We spend so much time in client calls explaining why the numbers don't match between platforms. It erodes trust even though it's not our fault."
Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"
Sarah: "Not very. We try to simplify it, but when you're showing Meta's attributed revenue, Google's attributed revenue, and our MTA tool's blended attribution, clients get confused. They want one true number. We've built custom dashboards, but keeping them updated is manual work. And honestly, sometimes we dumb it down too much and lose important nuance."
Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"
Sarah: "Unified campaign management and reporting across platforms. I want to build a campaign once, deploy it everywhere with platform-specific optimizations, and see all the performance in one place with reconciled attribution. We're doing the same work three times right now - once for Meta, once for Google, once for TikTok. That's insane."
Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"
Sarah: "One dashboard where I can see everything. Smart automation that understands business context - like, 'this client is running a sale, be more aggressive' or 'this creative theme is working everywhere, let's scale it.' Automated alert that actually catches problems before they blow up budgets. Creative testing that's automated - upload a bunch of variants, let the system test and allocate budget intelligently. And please, for the love of god, automated reporting that clients can actually understand."
Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally or to your clients?"
Sarah: "If I could show clients true incrementality - like, 'here's what you would have made without ads, here's what you made with ads, here's the lift.' Right now, we're always defending our numbers. If I could definitively prove impact, that's game-changing. Or if I could reduce my team's manual work by 50% and reallocate them to growth experiments, our client results would skyrocket."
Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"
Sarah: "Creative testing and budget optimization. AI should be able to look at creative performance across all platforms, identify winning themes, and automatically generate variants. Budget-wise, if AI could intelligently shift budget between platforms and campaigns based on performance, business context, and goals, that would be massive. Right now, humans are doing pattern matching that AI should be handling."
Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful  thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that unified cross-platform management, automated reporting, and better attribution are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"
Sarah: "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, just reducing manual busy work so we can focus on strategy."
Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"
Sarah: "Absolutely. Always interested in tools that might make life easier."
