Conversation 1: E-commerce Agency Performance DirectorProfile:* Role: Performance Marketing Director at 50-person e-commerce agency* Experience: 8 years in performance marketing* Manages: 15 DTC brands, $5M monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Google, TikTok, PinterestOpening: Rep: "Hey Sarah, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Sarah: "Yeah, absolutely. Always happy to talk shop about what's actually happening in the trenches versus what the platforms tell us should be happening."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Sarah: "We're a mid-size agency focused exclusively on e-commerce brands, mostly DTC. I oversee a team of six paid media specialists. Day-to-day, I'm jumping between client strategy calls, reviewing campaign performance, approving creative tests, and honestly, way too much time in spreadsheets trying to reconcile data from different platforms."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Sarah: "Mondays are all about weekly reporting - pulling data from Meta, Google, TikTok, Shopify, our attribution tool. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are campaign optimization days. Thursdays are client calls. Fridays are supposed to be strategic planning but usually turn into firefighting whatever broke during the week. We're also constantly testing new creative - probably launching 20-30 new ad variants per week across all clients."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Sarah: "TikTok has been crushing it for our younger-skewing brands. We're seeing CPAs 40-50% lower than Meta for some clients. Broad Match on Google has actually gotten better with their AI improvements. And we've finally gotten our creative production process down - we can turn around UGC-style content in 48 hours now."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Sarah: "Attribution is a nightmare. Every client wants to know true ROAS, but we're working with 5-6 different attribution windows across platforms, plus our MTA tool is giving us different numbers than the platforms, and Google Analytics 4 is... well, it's GA4. iOS 14 killed so much of our retargeting precision. And honestly, the amount of manual work hasn't decreased even though the platforms promise more automation - we're just automating different things while new manual work pops up."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Sarah: "Three big ones. First, attribution and measurement - we can't confidently tell clients what's actually working anymore. Second, the amount of manual platform hopping. I have team members with literally 15 browser tabs open just to check on campaigns. Third, creative testing at scale - we know testing is critical, but managing hundreds of ad variants across platforms manually is brutal. We're supposed to be strategic, but we're mostly doing data entry and manual QA."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Sarah: "Just last month, we launched a Black Friday campaign for a supplement brand. We had 60 ad variants across Meta and Google, 12 different audience segments, multiple landing pages. Campaign launched Friday at midnight. By Saturday afternoon, we noticed three ad sets on Meta had burned through 80% of daily budget by 10am because the CPA targets were too loose. But we didn't catch it until we manually checked because our alert system only monitors at account level, not ad set level. We lost probably $8K in wasted spend that weekend. Meanwhile, some Google campaigns weren't spending at all because of some obscure policy flag we didn't see. We basically spent the whole weekend in firefighting mode instead of optimizing for performance."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Sarah: "Honestly? In the gaps between platforms. Like, a client pauses campaigns in Shopify, but our Meta ads keep running. Or budget pacing issues - we set daily budgets but actual spend is super inconsistent, and we don't find out until end of day. Or creative gets disapproved on one platform but not others, and we don't have a centralized way to know. It's death by a thousand paper cuts."Rep: "How do you onboard new clients or campaigns? What's that process look like from start to finish?"Sarah: "It's a 3-4 week process. Week one is audit and strategy - we're manually pulling their historical data, building our tracking infrastructure, setting up our attribution. Week two is campaign buildout - manually creating campaigns in each platform, which is incredibly tedious when you're setting up similar campaigns across Meta, Google, and TikTok. Week three is creative production and QA. Week four is launch and monitoring. But here's the thing - probably 60% of that time is manual data entry and configuration that should be automatable but isn't."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Sarah: "Way more hands-on than we'd like. We check campaigns at least twice daily, sometimes more during launches or high-spend periods. The platform automation is okay for basic stuff, but it doesn't understand business context. Like, Google's Target CPA bidding doesn't know that our client is running a site-wide sale and we should actually be more aggressive. Or Meta's Advantage+ campaigns don't respect our need to test specific audience hypotheses. So we're constantly intervening manually."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Sarah: "Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, TikTok Ads Manager, Pinterest obviously. Then we have Triple Whale for some attribution and analytics, Google Analytics 4, Shopify analytics, Supermetrics for pulling data into Google Sheets, Slack for our internal comms, Asana for project management. Some clients use Northbeam or Rockerbox for attribution. And honestly, like six different spreadsheets that different team members built."Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Sarah: "What we love - Meta's creative testing tools are pretty good when they work. Google's responsive search ads actually perform well. TikTok's creative center is genuinely helpful for ideation. What's frustrating - nothing talks to each other. We're copying and pasting between platforms constantly. Reporting is manual. Each platform has its own idiosyncrasies - Meta calls it 'Ad Sets', Google calls it 'Ad Groups', TikTok calls it something else. The learning curve for new team members is massive because they have to learn six different interfaces."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Sarah: "Creative strategy, audience insights, and business context. Like, platforms can't know that our client is launching a new product line next week and we should be shifting budget. They can't understand brand voice in creative. They definitely can't handle client communication. But honestly, there's also a ton of manual work that should be automated but isn't - like bulk campaign creation, cross-platform budget reallocation, creative variant deployment."Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or creative testing?"Sarah: "My team collectively spends probably 40-50 hours per week on reporting alone. That's pulling data, reconciling numbers, building client decks. Creative testing management - uploading variants, tracking performance, analyzing results - is another 20-30 hours per week across the team. So we're talking 60-80 hours per week on stuff that feels like it should be automated."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Sarah: "Actually think strategically. Dive into customer research. Do competitive analysis. Test new platforms and tactics. Right now, we're so heads-down in execution that we barely have time for innovation. I'd also love to actually do cross-platform analysis - like, what if we could easily see which creative themes work across Meta AND Google AND TikTok? But that's a manual nightmare right now."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"Sarah: "Honestly, it's a mess. We're using last-click attribution for most reporting because it's simplest, but we know it's wrong. We're experimenting with Triple Whale's attribution, but clients are skeptical because the numbers don't match platform reporting. A few of our bigger clients are starting to ask about MMM, but that feels like enterprise-level stuff we can't quite justify yet. The real problem is that we have attribution data, but we don't trust it enough to make big budget decisions based on it."Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"Sarah: "Retargeting has gotten way less precise. We used to be able to do really granular retargeting - like, people who viewed this specific product collection but didn't add to cart. Now it's much broader. Our retargeting CPAs have probably gone up 30-40% over the last two years. We're compensating by going heavier on first-party data and really pushing our clients to build their email lists. But it's definitely not as effective as it used to be."Rep: "Are you experimenting with any first-party data approaches yet?"Sarah: "Yeah, we're pushing all our clients to implement server-side tracking and build customer match audiences. But it's slow going. Most of our clients are small brands without strong tech teams. Setting up Conversion API for Meta, enhanced conversions for Google - it's technical work that our clients struggle with. And then even when we get it set up, the match rates are lower than we'd like."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to data compliance or stakeholder reporting?"Sarah: "Compliance is honestly more of a 'check the box' thing for us right now - we make sure we have consent banners, we follow platform guidelines. But stakeholder reporting is painful. Clients want simple answers - 'what's my ROAS?' - but the honest answer is 'it depends on which attribution model and time window you use.' We spend so much time in client calls explaining why the numbers don't match between platforms. It erodes trust even though it's not our fault."Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"Sarah: "Not very. We try to simplify it, but when you're showing Meta's attributed revenue, Google's attributed revenue, and our MTA tool's blended attribution, clients get confused. They want one true number. We've built custom dashboards, but keeping them updated is manual work. And honestly, sometimes we dumb it down too much and lose important nuance."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Sarah: "Unified campaign management and reporting across platforms. I want to build a campaign once, deploy it everywhere with platform-specific optimizations, and see all the performance in one place with reconciled attribution. We're doing the same work three times right now - once for Meta, once for Google, once for TikTok. That's insane."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Sarah: "One dashboard where I can see everything. Smart automation that understands business context - like, 'this client is running a sale, be more aggressive' or 'this creative theme is working everywhere, let's scale it.' Automated alert that actually catches problems before they blow up budgets. Creative testing that's automated - upload a bunch of variants, let the system test and allocate budget intelligently. And please, for the love of god, automated reporting that clients can actually understand."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally or to your clients?"Sarah: "If I could show clients true incrementality - like, 'here's what you would have made without ads, here's what you made with ads, here's the lift.' Right now, we're always defending our numbers. If I could definitively prove impact, that's game-changing. Or if I could reduce my team's manual work by 50% and reallocate them to growth experiments, our client results would skyrocket."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"Sarah: "Creative testing and budget optimization. AI should be able to look at creative performance across all platforms, identify winning themes, and automatically generate variants. Budget-wise, if AI could intelligently shift budget between platforms and campaigns based on performance, business context, and goals, that would be massive. Right now, humans are doing pattern matching that AI should be handling."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that unified cross-platform management, automated reporting, and better attribution are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"Sarah: "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, just reducing manual busy work so we can focus on strategy."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Sarah: "Absolutely. Always interested in tools that might make life easier."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Mid-size e-commerce agency, 15 clients, $5M monthly spend* Top 3 Pains: (1) Unified cross-platform campaign management, (2) Attribution/measurement confusion, (3) Manual reporting workflow (60-80 hrs/week)* Tools Used: Meta, Google, TikTok, Pinterest, Triple Whale, Supermetrics, Shopify, Google Sheets* Workarounds: Multiple browser tabs, custom spreadsheets, manual data reconciliation* Key Quotes: "Death by a thousand paper cuts", "We're doing the same work three times", "We know it's wrong but use last-click because it's simplest"* Emotional Energy: Frustration around manual work and platform fragmentation, excitement about potential for automation* Follow-up: Yes, wants to see prototypesConversation 2: In-House SaaS Performance MarketerProfile:* Role: Senior Performance Marketing Manager at B2B SaaS company ($50M ARR)* Experience: 6 years, all in B2B* Manages: $200K monthly ad spend, team of 2* Platforms: Google, LinkedIn, FacebookOpening: Rep: "Hey Marcus, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Marcus: "Yeah, sure. Though I'll warn you, B2B paid is a different beast than e-commerce."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Marcus: "We're a project management software company, mid-market focus. I run all our paid acquisition - Google, LinkedIn, some Facebook. I have two people on my team - one focused on search, one on social. My day is split between campaign optimization, working with our content team on ad creative, analyzing conversion data in Salesforce, and a lot of stakeholder management. Everyone has opinions about the ads."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Marcus: "Monday mornings are pipeline review with sales - they want to know lead quality from paid. Rest of Monday is campaign optimization based on that feedback. Tuesday-Wednesday is new campaign development and creative testing. Thursday is cross-functional meetings - product marketing, content, sales ops. Friday is reporting and planning. I'm also constantly in Salesforce checking how our leads are progressing through the funnel."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Marcus: "LinkedIn has been solid for us - we've figured out our targeting and messaging. Our ICP is pretty specific and LinkedIn lets us get precise. Google search intent campaigns are strong - we know our keywords, we rank well organically, and paid supplements that nicely. Our conversion rate from demo request to closed-won has improved a lot."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Marcus: "Long sales cycles make optimization hard. We're making decisions on incomplete data because deals take 3-6 months to close. LinkedIn costs have gone up probably 50% in the last two years. Our CEO keeps asking why our CAC is going up, but it's the market. And honestly, connecting ad spend to revenue is really complex when you have a long, multi-touch sales cycle."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Marcus: "Three things keep me up at night. One, proving ROI on a long sales cycle. Two, lead quality - sales complains our leads aren't qualified enough, but if we get too restrictive, volume drops. Three, the gap between marketing metrics and sales metrics. Marketing says a lead is qualified, sales says it's not. We're constantly arguing about definitions."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Marcus: "Last quarter, we launched a big campaign around our new AI features. We targeted mid-market companies in specific verticals - great creative, good offer. Spent about $40K over six weeks. Got decent volume - maybe 200 leads. Marketing team was happy. Then sales comes back and says only 15 of those leads were actually qualified - wrong company size, wrong role, wrong use case. So our cost per qualified lead was way higher than we thought. Now we're trying to figure out if it was a targeting issue, a messaging issue, or a form issue. But the feedback loop is so slow - we won't know how many of those 15 actually close for months."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Marcus: "Usually in the handoff points. Ad to landing page - sometimes our page load times are slow and we lose people. Form submission to CRM - we've had issues with leads not syncing properly. Lead assignment to sales - sometimes qualified leads sit in a queue for days. Then sales attribution - we have three different teams claiming credit for the same deal. It's a mess."Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"Marcus: "It's pretty involved. First, we work with product marketing on positioning and messaging - that's 1-2 weeks. Then we develop creative assets with our design team - another 2-3 weeks. Then I build out the campaigns in each platform - Google, LinkedIn, maybe Facebook. Set up tracking, coordinate with our web team on landing pages, make sure Salesforce integration is working. Test everything. Then launch and monitor closely for the first week. All in, probably 4-6 weeks from concept to launch for a major campaign."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Marcus: "More hands-on than I'd like, but less than e-commerce probably. I check campaigns daily, but I'm not making constant tweaks like an e-commerce team would. Bigger issue is responding to sales feedback - they'll tell me a campaign is generating bad leads, so I have to adjust targeting or pause things. Or the CEO will see a competitor doing something and want us to react. So it's less about optimization mechanics and more about stakeholder management."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Marcus: "Google Ads, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, Facebook Ads Manager. Salesforce is our CRM. HubSpot for marketing automation and some landing pages. Google Analytics 4. Looker for our BI dashboards. We have Outreach for sales engagement. And like everyone, a bunch of Google Sheets for custom reporting."Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Marcus: "Love: Salesforce is powerful when it's set up right. LinkedIn's targeting is unmatched for B2B. Google's search intent is still king. Frustrating: nothing connects well. We have six different tools and they don't talk to each other. Salesforce is complex - takes months to get things configured right. HubSpot and Salesforce fight about data. Reporting requires pulling data from multiple places and manually reconciling it."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Marcus: "Understanding business context and sales feedback. Google's smart bidding doesn't know that Sales just told me leads from the healthcare vertical convert better. LinkedIn doesn't know that our Q4 budget just got cut. Platforms can't interpret qualitative feedback from sales calls. And automated bidding sometimes makes decisions that are technically optimal but strategically wrong - like shifting budget away from brand terms because the CPA is higher, even though those convert better downstream."Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or analysis?"Marcus: "Probably 10-15 hours per week on reporting. I pull ad platform data, match it to Salesforce leads, build custom reports for different stakeholders. Sales wants to see lead volume and quality. Finance wants to see CAC by channel. Our CEO wants to see pipeline influenced by paid. They all want different cuts of the same data. Plus I spend another 5-10 hours per week analyzing the data trying to find insights - what's working, what's not, where should we shift budget."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Marcus: "Test more. We only run 2-3 new campaigns per quarter because setup is so time-intensive. If I had more time, I'd experiment with new channels, test different messaging, try new targeting strategies. We're probably leaving growth on the table because we don't have capacity to test everything we should."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"Marcus: "Attribution is a constant debate. We use Salesforce's multi-touch attribution model, but sales doesn't trust it. They think paid gets too much credit. We've talked about doing a real incrementality test - like geo holdout or something - but we're not big enough to have the statistical power. MMM feels like overkill for us right now. Honestly, we mostly use proxy metrics - if pipeline from paid is growing and CAC is stable or improving, we're probably doing okay."Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"Marcus: "B2B retargeting was never as precise as B2C anyway. We're definitely seeing smaller audience sizes for retargeting, especially on Google. But we've compensated by focusing more on LinkedIn, which uses first-party data from people's profiles. We're also pushing harder on email nurture for people who don't convert immediately. Overall impact is there but not as catastrophic as e-commerce."Rep: "Are you experimenting with any first-party data approaches yet?"Marcus: "Yeah, we're uploading customer lists to LinkedIn and Google for customer match audiences. Works pretty well for expansion campaigns targeting existing customers. We're also doing more with our CRM data - like, targeting leads that went cold. But honestly, the operational lift of keeping those lists updated is more than I expected. We don't have a great automated process for it."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to stakeholder reporting?"Marcus: "Everyone wants different things. Sales wants lead volume and quality scores. Finance wants CAC and payback period. Our CEO wants to see ROI but doesn't understand that we won't know true ROI for 6-12 months because of sales cycle length. So I'm building three different reports with three different stories, and they don't always align. It's politically exhausting."Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"Marcus: "Not easy enough. I over-explain because I'm afraid they'll misinterpret. Like, I can't just show leads - I have to show MQLs, SQLs, opportunities, closed-won. But then they get lost in the funnel stages. I've tried simplifying, but then I get questions that require the detail. Can't win."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Marcus: "A closed loop between ad platforms and Salesforce that actually works. I want to see in real-time which campaigns are driving qualified pipeline, not just leads. I want to automatically shift budget to campaigns that drive deals, not just clicks. Right now, there's like a 3-6 month lag between ad click and knowing if it was worth it."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Marcus: "One source of truth for performance. I log in, I see ad spend, lead volume, lead quality scores from sales, opportunities created, pipeline value, and ideally closed-won revenue. All in one place, automatically updated. And smart recommendations - 'hey, healthcare campaigns are closing at 2x rate, shift budget there.' That would change my life."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally?"Marcus: "If I could definitively show which campaigns are driving revenue, not just leads. Right now, we have this black box between 'lead came from paid' and 'deal closed.' Sales takes credit, marketing takes credit, everyone's guessing. If I could illuminate that black box, I'd be a hero to both marketing and finance."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"Marcus: "Predictive lead scoring that actually works. Right now, we score leads based on job title and company size, but AI could look at way more signals - engagement, fit, intent. And intelligent budget allocation across campaigns based on downstream conversion, not just cost per lead. Also, creative testing - AI should be able to generate ad variants and test messaging at scale."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that closing the loop between ad platforms and Salesforce, streamlining stakeholder reporting, and better understanding of lead quality are your top pains. Did I get that right?"Marcus: "Yeah, exactly. And just generally operating with incomplete data because of long sales cycles."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Marcus: "Sure, always interested. Especially if it helps with Salesforce integration."Post-Call Notes:* Company: B2B SaaS, $50M ARR, 3-6 month sales cycle* Top 3 Pains: (1) Closed-loop attribution from ad to revenue, (2) Multiple stakeholder reporting requirements, (3) Lead quality assessment with slow feedback loops* Tools Used: Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Salesforce, HubSpot, GA4, Looker* Workarounds: Manual Salesforce data pulls, multiple custom reports for different stakeholders* Key Quotes: "Marketing says qualified, sales says it's not", "3-6 month lag between click and knowing if it was worth it", "Black box between lead and deal"* Emotional Energy: Frustration with stakeholder alignment, excitement about potential closed-loop systems* Follow-up: Yes, especially interested in Salesforce integrationConversation 3: Solo Performance Marketer for Small E-commerce BrandProfile:* Role: Head of Growth (only marketer) at startup beauty brand* Experience: 4 years* Manages: $30K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Google, TikTokOpening: Rep: "Hey Jen, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Jen: "Yeah, for sure. Fair warning though - I'm a one-person show, so my setup is probably pretty scrappy compared to what you usually see."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Jen: "We're a small beauty brand, about $2M in annual revenue, growing fast. I'm literally the only person doing marketing full-time. I run all our paid ads, email, social organic, work with influencers, and help with our website. It's a lot. Day-to-day is basically firefighting - checking ads in the morning, responding to customer comments, coordinating with our creative contractor, updating email flows, and trying to squeeze in time for actual strategy."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Rep: "Chaotic, honestly. Every morning I check if ads are still running and nothing broke overnight. Then I'm jumping between Meta, Google, and TikTok checking performance. I'm also responding to DMs, updating product pages, writing email campaigns. Weekends I'm usually planning content and creative for the next week. There's no typical week - it's all reactive."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Jen: "Our TikTok organic is crushing it - we went viral twice last month. Meta ads are profitable, finally - took us a year to figure out the right creative approach. Our email flows are running on autopilot and printing money. And our founder is really good on camera, so we're leaning into founder-led content."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Jen: "Everything takes longer than I think. Creative production is a constant bottleneck - I can't test fast enough. iOS privacy changes killed our retargeting. Costs keep going up on Meta. And I'm just stretched so thin - I know I'm leaving money on the table because I don't have time to optimize properly. Like, I should be testing Google Shopping more, but I barely have time to keep Meta and TikTok running."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Jen: "Time and resources, full stop. I'm the entire marketing team. I don't have someone to create ads, someone to run campaigns, someone to analyze data. It's all me. So I'm constantly triaging - what absolutely needs to get done today versus what can wait. I know I should be testing more, running experiments, but I'm just trying to keep the machine running."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Jen: "Two weeks ago, we launched a new product. I spent a weekend building out ads for Meta and Google - different copy for each platform, different creative formats, setting up new campaigns. Monday morning, Meta rejected half our ads for some vague policy violation. I spent hours going back and forth with support. Meanwhile, Google campaigns weren't spending because I messed up the budget pacing. By the time I got everything running smoothly, it was Wednesday, and we'd basically lost our launch momentum. It was supposed to be this big coordinated launch, and it was just... messy."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Jen: "A lot of times it's just me forgetting something or not having time to QA properly. Like, I'll launch a campaign on Meta but forget to update the landing page. Or I'll set up Google ads but the tracking pixel isn't firing correctly and I don't realize for three days. It's operational stuff that a bigger team would catch, but I'm a team of one so things slip through."Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"Jen: "Super scrappy. I usually start with creative - work with our contractor to get photos and videos. That takes maybe a week. Then I write copy in a Google Doc. Then I'm manually building campaigns in Meta, then Google, maybe TikTok if I have budget. I'm copying and pasting a lot because the platforms are different but the messaging is similar. Takes me probably a full day to build everything out. Then I test and launch. No fancy planning - just get it done."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Jen: "I wish I could set and forget, but that's not reality. I'm in the ad platforms every day because something always needs attention. Budget ran out early. An ad creative stopped working. CPMs spiked. I'm constantly putting out fires. The platforms have automation, but I don't trust them enough to just walk away."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Jen: "Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, TikTok Ads Manager. Shopify for our store. Klaviyo for email. Later for social scheduling. Google Analytics because I'm supposed to, but I barely look at it. And a million Google Sheets to track everything because I don't have a real analytics tool."Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Jen: "Love: Meta's creative tools are actually pretty good. Klaviyo is solid for email. Shopify just works. Frustrating: I'm logged into five different platforms every day doing essentially the same thing - checking performance, adjusting budgets, launching creative. It's so inefficient. And reporting is a nightmare - I have to pull data from each platform and manually compile it. Takes hours."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Jen: "Creative and strategy. Platforms can optimize bids, but they can't write compelling ad copy or produce engaging video. They also don't understand my business - like, Meta doesn't know we're launching a new product line next month and I should be seeding that messaging now. Automation handles the mechanics, but I still have to do all the thinking."Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or creative management?"Jen: "Probably 5-6 hours on reporting - pulling data, making sense of it, creating something our founder and investors can understand. Creative management - briefing our contractor, reviewing content, uploading to platforms, organizing assets - that's another 8-10 hours per week easily. So almost half my week is just operational stuff that doesn't feel strategic."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Jen: "Honestly? Test more aggressively. I have so many ideas but no time to execute. I'd also work on our retention marketing more - we're too focused on acquisition. And I'd love to actually learn from our data instead of just reporting it. Like, what creative themes really work? What audiences are our best customers? I'm too busy executing to analyze."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"Jen: "I'm not, really. That's enterprise-level stuff that I don't have time or budget for. I look at blended ROAS across all channels and if it's above our target, we're good. I know that's not sophisticated, but it's what I can manage. Occasionally I'll pause a channel to see what happens to overall revenue, but that's about as fancy as I get with incrementality."Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"Jen: "Huge hit. We used to have really specific retargeting sequences - people who viewed products, people who added to cart, people who started checkout. Now those audiences are tiny and the targeting is mushy. We're getting way less precise. I've compensated by going harder on email for retargeting and using Meta's broader targeting, but it's definitely not as effective."Rep: "Are you experimenting with any first-party data approaches yet?"Jen: "I set up the Meta Conversions API, which was a pain but helps. We're starting to build our SMS list. But honestly, I don't have time to get fancy with it. Like, I know we should be doing more with customer data, but I'm already maxed out."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to data or reporting?"Jen: "Just the manual work of pulling it all together. Our founder wants weekly updates on ads performance, email performance, revenue. I'm literally copying numbers from six different places into a Google Sheet. It's tedious and I definitely make mistakes sometimes. And I never have time to actually dig into the data - I'm just reporting numbers, not insights."Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"Jen: "I try to keep it simple - revenue, ROAS, CAC. But our founder sometimes asks questions I can't answer easily, like 'which ad creative is driving the most revenue?' or 'what's our repeat purchase rate by acquisition channel?' Those require way more work to figure out."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Jen: "One dashboard for everything. I'm so tired of logging into five different platforms. I want to see all my ads, all my performance, all my budgets in one place. And honestly, something that would automate the repetitive stuff - like, I'm copying and pasting between platforms constantly. That should be automated."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Jen: "Simple and fast. I don't need fancy features - I need something that saves me time. Unified campaign creation so I'm not building the same campaign three times. Automated reporting so I'm not pulling data manually. And maybe smart alerts that tell me when something needs my attention, so I'm not checking everything constantly. I need tools built for someone who's doing ten jobs, not one."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero?"Jen: "If I could double our testing velocity. Right now, we test maybe 2-3 new creative concepts per month because production and deployment is so slow. If I could test 10-15, we'd find winners faster and grow faster. Our founder knows we should be testing more, so if I could show that we're experimenting rapidly, that would be huge."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"Jen: "Creative production and deployment. Like, I should be able to give AI a brief and it generates variants for me to review. Or upload one video and have it automatically reformatted for different platform specs. And definitely automated campaign setup - I shouldn't have to manually build the same campaign in three places. AI should handle all the tedious stuff so I can focus on strategy."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that time management as a solo marketer, unified platform access, and automating repetitive tasks are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"Jen: "Yeah, exactly. I just need more leverage. I'm doing way too much manually."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Jen: "Definitely. If it saves me even a few hours per week, that's worth it."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Small beauty brand, $2M revenue, solo marketer* Top 3 Pains: (1) Time management - wearing too many hats, (2) Unified dashboard/platform access, (3) Manual campaign deployment across multiple platforms* Tools Used: Meta, Google, TikTok, Shopify, Klaviyo, Later, Google Sheets* Workarounds: Manual copy-paste between platforms, Google Sheets for everything, weekend work to stay caught up* Key Quotes: "I'm the entire marketing team", "Something always needs attention", "Almost half my week is operational stuff"* Emotional Energy: Overwhelmed but scrappy, excited about anything that creates leverage* Follow-up: Yes, very interested in time-saving toolsConversation 4: Enterprise E-commerce Performance Marketing DirectorProfile:* Role: Director of Performance Marketing at Fortune 500 retail brand* Experience: 12 years in performance marketing* Manages: $15M annual ad spend, team of 12* Platforms: Google, Meta, Amazon, Criteo, The Trade DeskOpening: Rep: "Hey Rachel, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Rachel: "Sure, though I'll mention upfront that enterprise marketing operates pretty differently from what you might see at smaller companies. Lots of stakeholders, complex approval processes, legacy systems."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Rachel: "We're a major retail brand with both physical stores and e-commerce. I oversee all digital performance marketing - search, social, display, Amazon advertising. I have a team of 12 split across channel specialists, an analytics team, and creative producers. My day-to-day is mostly strategic - reviewing performance dashboards, meeting with my team leads, stakeholder presentations, budget planning, and working with our agency partners on larger initiatives."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Rachel: "Mondays are team sync meetings - each channel lead presents their performance and plans. Tuesdays I'm usually in cross-functional meetings - merchandising, finance, IT, brand team. Wednesdays are agency meetings - we work with three different agencies for different channels. Thursdays are analysis and planning days. Fridays are executive presentations or planning sessions. I'm probably in meetings 25-30 hours per week, which is too much but typical for enterprise."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Rachel: "Our omnichannel approach is finally coming together - we can see when digital ads drive store visits. Amazon is growing fast and profitable. Our Google Shopping campaigns are extremely efficient because of all the product feed work we've done. And we've actually gotten pretty good at moving fast for a large company - we can launch campaigns in days instead of weeks now."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Rachel: "Privacy changes have been brutal. Our retargeting audiences are a fraction of what they were two years ago. Getting different systems to talk to each other is a constant battle - our POS system, e-commerce platform, ad platforms, data warehouse. And honestly, organizational complexity slows everything down. Simple decisions require five layers of approval. Our tech stack is also a Frankenstein monster - we have legacy systems that are 15 years old running alongside new tools."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Rachel: "I'd say three major areas. First, data infrastructure and integration. We have data everywhere but it's siloed - ad platform data, website analytics, in-store data, CRM data. Getting a unified view is really hard. Second, organizational agility. We're competing with digitally native brands that move 10x faster than us. By the time we get approval for a campaign, the moment has passed. Third, attribution in an omnichannel world. We need to understand how paid search impacts store visits, how social ads influence Amazon purchases, how display builds brand awareness that converts later through organic channels. It's complex."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Rachel: "We wanted to launch a campaign around a competitor's product recall - we had a competitive advantage and wanted to capitalize quickly. Our team identified the opportunity on a Monday. By the time we got through legal review, brand approval, creative development, media planning, and all the sign-offs, it was three weeks later and the news cycle had moved on. We launched the campaign but it was too late - the moment had passed. That's the frustration of enterprise - we have all the resources but can't move fast enough."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Rachel: "Usually at integration points between systems. Like, our inventory system doesn't update fast enough, so we advertise products that are out of stock. Or our CRM data doesn't sync properly with ad platforms, so customer match audiences are stale. Or different teams use different tracking parameters, so attribution gets messy. We have a lot of technical debt from years of bolting on new systems without proper integration planning."Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"Rachel: "It's pretty formalized. First, we develop the campaign brief - objectives, target audience, messaging, budget. That goes through stakeholder review. Then we work with creative teams on assets - 2-3 weeks for production. Then campaign buildout across platforms - our team or agencies handle this. QA process - we have a checklist of like 40 items. Legal and compliance review - another week usually. Then launch and monitoring. End to end, major campaigns take 6-8 weeks from concept to launch. Smaller campaigns we can turn around in 2-3 weeks."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Rachel: "Mix of both. We have automation handling a lot of the optimization - Google Smart Bidding, Meta's Advantage+, our DSP algorithms. But my team monitors daily because at our scale, small issues become big problems fast. Like, if an automated system makes a bidding mistake and we overspend by 10%, that's potentially $30K-40K in a single day. So we have humans in the loop checking everything."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Rachel: "Ad platforms - Google Ads, Meta, Amazon Advertising, The Trade Desk, Criteo, Pinterest. Analytics - Google Analytics 360, Adobe Analytics. BI and data - Tableau, our data warehouse built on Snowflake. Attribution - we have a marketing mix modeling partner. CRM - Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Creative - Adobe Creative Suite. Project management - Jira, Monday.com. We probably have 30+ marketing tools in our stack."Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Rachel: "Love: We have best-in-class tools for everything. Google Analytics 360 is powerful. Adobe Analytics lets us do deep analysis. The Trade Desk gives us great programmatic control. Frustrating: Nothing talks to each other properly. We spend more time on data engineering than marketing. Every tool has its own dashboard, its own definitions, its own way of doing things. We've tried to build unified dashboards but it's constantly breaking because APIs change or data schemas shift. And the cost - we spend millions on marketing technology, which eats into our media budget."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Rachel: "Strategic decisions and creative intuition. Automation can optimize to a KPI, but it can't understand brand strategy or competitive positioning. It can't tell you that we should invest in a new channel before the data proves it out. It also can't handle exceptions - like when there's a PR crisis and we need to pause all advertising immediately, or when supply chain issues mean we need to stop advertising certain products. And automation definitely can't navigate organizational politics, which is half my job."Rep: "How much time does your team spend on manual reporting or data reconciliation?"Rachel: "Way too much. I'd estimate 30-40% of my analytics team's time is spent on data wrangling - pulling data from different sources, reconciling discrepancies, formatting reports for different audiences. We probably dedicate 2-3 full-time people just to reporting. It's ridiculous when you think about it - we have millions in technology, but we still need humans to manually compile data."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Rachel: "Deep analysis and testing. We do a lot of reporting but not enough insight generation. I'd love my team to spend time understanding why things work, not just what happened. More competitive analysis. More customer research. More experimentation with new channels and tactics. Right now, we're so busy keeping the lights on that we don't have time for innovation."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"Rachel: "We do all three. We run geo holdout tests quarterly to measure incrementality - essential at our scale. We have a multi-touch attribution model, though we take it with a grain of salt. And we invest in marketing mix modeling annually with an external partner. The reality is that no single measurement approach is perfect, so we triangulate. If all three methods tell us search is working well, we trust that. Where they disagree, we dig deeper."Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"Rachel: "Significant impact. Our retargeting audiences are maybe 60% of what they were pre-iOS 14. CPMs have gone up because everyone's bidding on smaller audiences. We've had to shift strategy - less granular retargeting, more contextual targeting, more first-party data activation. We're also investing heavily in our CRM and loyalty program to build first-party relationships. It's a multi-year strategic shift for us."Rep: "Are you experimenting with first-party data approaches?"Rachel: "Heavily. We're uploading customer lists to all platforms for customer match targeting. We're using our loyalty program data to build lookalike audiences. We're implementing server-side tracking across our properties. We just launched a clean room partnership with a retail media network. First-party data is now a competitive advantage - we have millions of customers, which gives us scale that smaller brands don't have."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to data compliance or stakeholder reporting?"Rachel: "Compliance is actually pretty manageable - we have legal and privacy teams handling that. Stakeholder reporting is the real headache. Every executive wants different things. CFO wants CAC and payback period. CMO wants brand lift and engagement metrics. CEO wants top-line revenue impact. Head of stores wants to see store visit lift. Merchandising wants category-level performance. I'm creating five different reports for five different audiences. And they all want it in different formats on different schedules."Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"Rachel: "It's gotten better, but there's still confusion. Executives don't always understand the nuances of attribution or why different channels have different success metrics. We spend a lot of time in meetings explaining the numbers. I've started including 'so what' sections in every report - here's what the data means, here's what we're doing about it. But data literacy at the executive level is still a challenge."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Rachel: "Unified data infrastructure. I want one source of truth where all our marketing data lives, properly integrated, with consistent definitions and metrics. We waste so much time and money on duct-taping systems together. If we had a proper marketing data platform that everything connected to, it would transform how we operate."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Rachel: "Enterprise-grade but flexible. Something that can handle our scale - billions in revenue, millions of customers, hundreds of campaigns - but still let us move fast. Real-time data across all channels. Smart automation that understands business rules and constraints. And critically, something that works with our legacy systems without requiring us to rip and replace everything. We can't do a big bang migration - we need tools that meet us where we are."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally?"Rachel: "If I could demonstrate that our performance marketing directly drives profitable growth at scale. Right now, there's always doubt - are we just getting credit for sales that would've happened anyway? If I could prove incrementality clearly and show a path to scaling profitably, that would be game-changing. Or if I could somehow cut our reporting time by 50% and redeploy those resources to growth initiatives."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"Rachel: "Three areas. One, automated data integration and reconciliation - AI should be able to pull data from different sources, identify the same customer across platforms, and give us unified reporting. Two, predictive budget allocation - AI should look at all our historical data and tell us how to allocate next quarter's budget for maximum ROI. Three, automated creative optimization - we have thousands of products, AI should be able to generate and test creative variants at scale. We're too big to do everything manually but too complex for simple automation."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that unified data infrastructure, organizational agility, and omnichannel attribution are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"Rachel: "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, just managing the complexity of enterprise at scale."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Rachel: "Sure, though fair warning - enterprise sales cycles are long and you'll need to talk to procurement, security, IT, and like five other teams. But yes, I'm interested in seeing what you build."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Fortune 500 retail, $15M annual ad spend, 12-person team* Top 3 Pains: (1) Unified data infrastructure across siloed systems, (2) Organizational complexity slowing decision-making, (3) Omnichannel attribution* Tools Used: Google, Meta, Amazon, The Trade Desk, Criteo, GA360, Adobe Analytics, Tableau, Snowflake, Salesforce* Workarounds: 2-3 FTE dedicated to manual reporting, triangulating multiple measurement approaches* Key Quotes: "We have all the resources but can't move fast enough", "Nothing talks to each other properly", "30-40% of time on data wrangling"* Emotional Energy: Frustrated by complexity and legacy systems, but sophisticated in approach* Follow-up: Yes, but needs enterprise sales approachConversation 5: Mobile Gaming User Acquisition ManagerProfile:* Role: UA Manager at mobile game studio* Experience: 5 years in mobile gaming* Manages: $500K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Facebook, Google UAC, Apple Search Ads, Unity Ads, ironSourceOpening: Rep: "Hey Kevin, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Kevin: "Yeah, cool. Mobile gaming UA is pretty different from other performance marketing, so hopefully what I share is useful."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Kevin: "We're a mid-size mobile game studio with about five games in market. I focus on user acquisition for our flagship game - getting installs profitably. Day-to-day is checking overnight performance from different geos, analyzing cohort data, testing new ad networks, working with our creative team on ad concepts, and trying to hit our LTV:CAC targets. Mobile gaming is super data-intensive."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Kevin: "Every morning starts with checking overnight performance - we advertise globally, so campaigns run 24/7. Then I'm optimizing - adjusting bids, turning off underperforming ad sets, scaling winners. Couple times a week I have creative reviews with our video team. I spend a lot of time in our BI tools looking at Day 7, Day 30 LTV by cohort. And I'm constantly testing new networks and placements - the landscape changes fast in mobile."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Kevin: "Apple Search Ads is printing money for us right now - people searching for our game genre convert really well. Google UAC has gotten better with their creative automation. We've also figured out our creative formula for playable ads - our IPM has gone up like 30%. And our Day 7 retention is trending up, which gives us more room to spend."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Kevin: "ATT has been devastating. We lost probably 60-70% of our iOS targeting precision. CPIs have gone up across the board. Finding scale is really hard - we can profitably acquire maybe 2,000 installs per day, but to grow we need 10,000+ and every time we try to scale, efficiency tanks. Android is also getting more competitive - everyone's piling into Android because iOS is so hard now."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Kevin: "Three things keep me up. One, attribution and measurement - with ATT and probabilistic matching, I'm making decisions on incomplete data. Two, creative performance is wildly inconsistent - an ad that works great one week dies the next week. Three, the constant platform changes. Every ad network changes their algorithm, updates their targeting options, or shifts their auction dynamics. What worked last month might not work this month."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Kevin: "Last month we tried to scale into a new geo - Brazil. We translated our top-performing creative, launched campaigns across Facebook, Google, and Unity. First week looked great - CPIs were lower than our target. Then week two, retention numbers came in and they were terrible - like 40% worse than our core geos. Turned out the creative that works in US and Europe doesn't resonate in Brazil at all. By the time we realized and pivoted, we'd spent like $40K on users who are probably going to churn. That's the problem with mobile - you don't know if installs are good until days or weeks later."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Kevin: "Usually it's either targeting issues or creative fatigue. Like, Facebook's Advantage+ will suddenly shift spend to a terrible placement and CPIs spike. Or an ad creative that's been working for weeks suddenly hits fatigue and performance craters. The algorithms are also black boxes - something changes, we don't know why, and we have to react. With probabilistic attribution, I'm never 100% sure what's actually working."Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"Kevin: "Depends on the network. For Facebook, I'm setting up multiple campaigns with different creative approaches, audiences, and optimization goals. Takes maybe 2-3 hours to build out a full test. Then I let it run for 3-5 days to exit the learning phase. Meanwhile, I'm setting up tracking in our MMP - making sure installs are attributing correctly. After a week, I look at cohort data and decide what to scale. Similar process for Google UAC and other networks. It's pretty manual - lots of campaign creation, tracking setup, testing."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Kevin: "Super hands-on. I'm in the platforms multiple times per day. Creative fatigue is real in mobile - an ad can go from performing well to terrible in 24 hours. I'm constantly monitoring IPM, CPI, and early retention signals. And I'm moving budgets around between networks based on what's working. Can't just set it and forget it in this space."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Kevin: "Ad networks - Facebook, Google UAC, Apple Search Ads, Unity, ironSource, AppLovin, Vungle. We use Adjust as our MMP for attribution. Data analysis in Looker and Google Sheets. Creative testing we use a mix of internal tools and Playable Factory. And honestly, our game's own analytics dashboard to track retention and monetization. That's where the real answer is - did these users make us money?"Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Kevin: "Love: Apple Search Ads is straightforward and works. Google UAC has gotten way better at creative optimization. Adjust gives us good attribution data. Frustrating: Every network has different metrics, different attribution windows, different ways of reporting. Facebook calls it CPA, Google calls it CPI, Unity has its own terminology. Reconciling data across networks is painful. And MMPs charge a fortune for attribution - we're paying like $30K+ annually just for tracking."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Kevin: "Creative strategy and cohort analysis. Platforms can optimize bids, but they can't tell me if the users we're acquiring are actually valuable long-term. That requires looking at Day 7, Day 30 LTV data and making strategic decisions. Also, algorithms optimize for installs or early actions, but don't understand lifetime value. I have to manually shift budgets to campaigns driving high-LTV users, even if their Day 1 metrics look worse."Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or analysis?"Kevin: "Probably 10-12 hours per week pulling data, analyzing cohorts, building reports for our executive team. Every Monday I'm building a performance deck showing last week's installs, spend, CPIs, retention curves, and LTV projections. It's mostly manual - exporting CSVs from each network, matching to cohort data from Adjust and our game analytics, building charts in Google Sheets."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Kevin: "Test more aggressively. We should be testing way more creative concepts, more ad networks, more geo expansions. But I'm so busy managing existing campaigns and doing reporting that I don't have time to experiment. I'd also love to do deeper analysis - like, what creative themes actually drive high-LTV users? But that requires combining ad platform data with in-game behavior data, which is super manual."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality and attribution right now?"Kevin: "Attribution is hard in mobile. We use Adjust for install attribution, but with ATT, a huge chunk of iOS installs are 'probabilistic' or even 'unknown.' We basically have to run on faith that our spend is working. For incrementality, we occasionally run geo tests - advertise in some cities, not others, see if there's a lift. But it's not something we do systematically. Mostly we trust that if our blended LTV:CAC is above target, we're good."Rep: "How has ATT changed your strategy?"Kevin: "Completely reshaped it. Pre-ATT, we could do really granular retargeting and lookalike audiences on iOS. Now it's much broader targeting. We've had to get way better at creative because we can't rely on targeting precision. We've also shifted more budget to Android where we still have better targeting. And we're investing more in ASA because Apple's own ad platform obviously has better data than third parties."Rep: "Are you experimenting with any new measurement approaches?"Kevin: "We're using SKAN for iOS attribution now, which is... okay. Better than nothing but way less granular than IDFA was. We're also starting to use fingerprinting more for Android. And we're building out more sophisticated LTV models - trying to predict Day 90 LTV from Day 1 behavior so we can optimize faster. But honestly, a lot of it is just accepting more uncertainty than we used to have."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to stakeholder reporting?"Kevin: "Explaining why we can't just 'spend more' when things are working. Leadership sees we're acquiring users profitably and asks why we don't 5x the budget. But in mobile, scale and efficiency are inversely correlated - the more you spend, the worse your CPIs get. I'm constantly educating on how auction dynamics work and why hitting our targets at current scale doesn't mean we can just scale infinitely."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Kevin: "Unified performance dashboard across all networks with cohort data integrated. I want to see in real-time which campaigns are driving valuable users, not just cheap installs. Right now, that requires stitching together three different data sources manually. If I could log into one dashboard and see everything, that would change my life."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Kevin: "Something that shows me campaign performance, but weighted by LTV not just CPI. Like, 'Campaign A has a $3 CPI but $8 Day 30 LTV, scale it up. Campaign B has a $2 CPI but $4 Day 30 LTV, kill it.' The platforms optimize for installs because that's what they can measure, but I care about valuable users. I need a system that bridges that gap."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally?"Kevin: "If I could consistently scale spend while maintaining or improving efficiency. Right now, we're stuck at a local maximum - we're profitable but can't grow. If I could find a way to 2x or 3x our daily install volume without tanking our LTV:CAC ratio, I'd be a hero. That probably requires better creative testing or new network discovery."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"Kevin: "Creative testing at scale. We should be generating hundreds of ad variants, testing them across networks, and automatically scaling winners. Right now, we produce maybe 10 new creatives per month and manually deploy them. If AI could handle creative production and testing, we'd iterate way faster. Also, automated budget optimization across networks based on LTV, not just CPI. Shift budget from low-LTV sources to high-LTV sources automatically."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that unified cross-network reporting with LTV integration, creative testing at scale, and dealing with post-ATT measurement challenges are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"Kevin: "Yeah, exactly. Mobile UA is all about making smart decisions with imperfect data, and anything that improves my data quality or decision-making is valuable."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Kevin: "For sure.

To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Tom: "We're an HVAC and plumbing company serving a 50-mile radius. We've got about 30 technicians in the field. I handle all our marketing - paid ads, website, review management, email, some social media. Day-to-day is pretty reactive. I'm checking leads that came in overnight, making sure they got routed to our call center, monitoring our ad spend, responding to reviews, and dealing with whatever fires pop up."Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"Tom: "Mondays I review weekend lead volume and quality with our operations manager - did the leads show up for appointments? Tuesdays and Wednesdays I'm optimizing campaigns, adjusting bids based on what services are booking out. Thursdays I'm working on content - updating website, responding to reviews, posting on social. Fridays are reporting to our GM on lead volume and costs. I'm also on call for urgent stuff - like if a big storm hits, we need to ramp up emergency service ads immediately."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Tom: "Google Local Services Ads are crushing it - we're getting way more calls from those than regular search ads. Our reviews are strong, which helps conversion. We've also gotten good at seasonal adjustment - we know exactly when to push AC repair vs heating repair vs plumbing based on time of year and weather. And our call tracking is finally working properly so we can see which ads actually drive calls that turn into jobs."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Tom: "Lead quality is always a challenge - we get lots of tire kickers or people who aren't in our service area. Google's location targeting isn't as precise as we need. Budgeting is tough because demand is so seasonal - we might spend $20K one month and $60K the next depending on weather. And coordinating between marketing and operations is hard - sometimes we get a ton of leads but our technicians are already booked solid."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"Tom: "Three main things. One, lead quality over quantity - we need leads that actually turn into booked jobs, not just phone calls. Two, managing budget during demand spikes - when there's a heat wave, we want to spend more, but we have daily budget caps and it's hard to react fast. Three, proving ROI to our owner. He sees the ad spend but doesn't always see the connection to booked revenue because there's a lag between lead and job completion."Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating Ñ what happened?"Tom: "A few weeks ago we had a major cold snap. We knew emergency heating calls would spike, so I wanted to increase our budget and push heating repair ads hard. But by the time I adjusted budgets in Google, updated ad copy, and got everything running, it was already day two of the cold snap. Then our phone lines got overwhelmed - too many leads, not enough call capacity. Some calls went to voicemail, and we lost jobs. The whole thing showed how hard it is to react quickly when you're wearing multiple hats."Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"Tom: "Usually it's operational bottlenecks, not ad performance. Like, ads drive leads, but then our call center drops the ball on follow-up. Or we book the job but the technician is late and the customer cancels. Or we advertise services we can't actually handle because our team is booked. The marketing piece is actually pretty straightforward - it's the coordination with operations that's hard."Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"Tom: "Pretty simple for us. I usually start with keyword research for a new service. Then I build out Google Search campaigns with location targeting and call extensions. Maybe create some Facebook ads with before/after photos. Set up call tracking numbers. Test it for a week or two with a small budget. If it's working, I scale it up. The whole process takes maybe 3-5 days. We're not sophisticated - I'm basically copying what worked for similar services and tweaking."Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"Tom: "Hands-on, especially during busy season. I'm checking lead volume every morning. If we're getting too many leads and operations can't handle it, I need to reduce bids or pause campaigns. If it's slow, I need to increase bids. I'm also constantly adjusting based on weather - if rain is coming, I push our emergency plumbing ads because we know we'll get basement flooding calls."Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"Tom: "Google Ads - both regular search and Local Services Ads. Facebook for brand awareness and retargeting. Yelp ads sometimes, but they're expensive. CallRail for call tracking. Our CRM is ServiceTitan, which tracks jobs from lead to invoice. And I use Google Sheets for reporting because our owner likes simple spreadsheets."Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"Tom: "Love: Google Local Services Ads are pay-per-lead, which is great - we only pay when someone actually calls. ServiceTitan is solid for tracking jobs. Frustrating: Nothing talks to each other. I'm manually pulling lead data from CallRail, matching it to job data from ServiceTitan, and reconciling with ad spend from Google. Takes me hours each week. Also, Google's location targeting is imprecise - we serve a 50-mile radius, but we get calls from people 70 miles away who aren't worth driving to."Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"Tom: "Definitely lead qualification and routing. An AI can't tell if a call is a legit emergency or someone price shopping five companies. Our call center has to qualify leads, and that's very human. Also, seasonal and weather-based adjustments require local knowledge - I know that when temps drop below freezing, we should push furnace repair. Google's automated bidding doesn't understand that nuance."Rep: "How much time do you spend each week on manual reporting or admin work?"Tom: "Probably 8-10 hours per week. Pulling lead reports, creating performance summaries for our GM, reconciling ad spend with revenue, chasing down operations to see which leads turned into jobs. It's tedious but necessary because our owner wants to see ROI on every dollar we spend on ads."Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"Tom: "I'd focus more on reviews and reputation management - that's huge in local services but I never have enough time for it. I'd also do more content marketing - blog posts, videos, SEO work. We get good organic traffic, but I could grow it if I had more time. And honestly, I'd test some new channels - maybe YouTube ads or local sponsorships."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about attribution for local services?"Tom: "Pretty simple - we track phone calls with CallRail, so we can see which ads drove which calls. Then we match those calls to jobs in ServiceTitan. It's not perfect - sometimes people call multiple times, or they call from a different number than they book with. But it gives us a decent sense of which campaigns are driving actual revenue, not just leads."Rep: "How do you handle seasonal fluctuations in demand?"Tom: "It's tricky. Summer is huge for AC, winter is huge for heating, spring has plumbing from freezing pipes. We adjust budget monthly based on historical trends. But weather is unpredictable - an early heat wave means we need to ramp AC ads fast. I wish there was a way to automatically scale budget based on external signals like weather forecasts, but right now it's manual."Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to proving ROI?"Tom: "The lag between lead and revenue. Someone calls today, we book a job, the technician goes out in three days, then we invoice, then they pay in 30 days. So the revenue from today's ad spend doesn't show up for a month or more. My boss sees the ad spend immediately but doesn't see the payoff for weeks. I'm constantly defending the budget."Rep: "How important are reviews and reputation for your business?"Tom: "Absolutely critical. We're at 4.8 stars on Google with 500+ reviews, and that's our biggest competitive advantage. People search for HVAC near them, they see us at the top with great reviews, they call. If our reviews dropped, our conversion rate would tank. I spend as much time managing our reputation as I do on ads."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Tom: "Closed-loop reporting that's automated. I want to see in one dashboard: here's how much we spent on ads, here's how many leads we got, here's how many turned into booked jobs, here's how much revenue those jobs generated. Right now, I'm manually stitching that together from three different systems. If that was automatic, I'd save hours every week."Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"Tom: "Something that connects Google Ads to our call tracking to our CRM. Ideally with weather integration - like, system sees a heat wave is coming, automatically suggests increasing AC repair bids. And smart lead routing - high-value leads go to our best techs, tire kickers get filtered out. Basically, something that handles the manual coordination work I'm doing between marketing and operations."Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally?"Tom: "If I could reduce our cost per booked job while increasing volume. Our owner cares about one thing - how much do we spend to get a completed job? If I could show that we're getting more efficient - better lead quality, better conversion rates, lower waste - that's a win. Or if I could predict slow periods and help operations schedule better."Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation could be?"Tom: "Dynamic budget allocation based on demand signals - weather, seasonality, current booking levels. And automated lead qualification - use AI to screen calls, identify high-intent leads, route them properly. We waste a lot of time on bad leads. If that could be automated, it would be huge."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that closed-loop ROI reporting, managing seasonal demand fluctuations, and lead quality filtering are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"Tom: "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, just connecting all our systems so data flows automatically instead of me being the middleman."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Tom: "Sure thing. Anything that saves me time or improves our ROI is worth looking at."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Regional HVAC/plumbing, 30 technicians, $40K monthly spend* Top 3 Pains: (1) Closed-loop reporting from ad spend to completed jobs, (2) Reactive budget management for seasonal/weather fluctuations, (3) Lead quality and qualification* Tools Used: Google Ads, Local Services Ads, Facebook, CallRail, ServiceTitan, Google Sheets* Workarounds: Manual data stitching between call tracking and CRM, manual budget adjustments for weather* Key Quotes: "Marketing is straightforward, coordination with operations is hard", "Revenue lag makes defending budget difficult", "Can't tell if a call is legit or price shopping"* Emotional Energy: Pragmatic, focused on operational efficiency and ROI* Follow-up: YesConversation 7: Agency Founder/OwnerProfile:* Role: Founder & CEO of boutique performance marketing agency* Experience: 10 years, started agency 5 years ago* Manages: 25 clients, $3M annual ad spend across portfolio, team of 8* Platforms: Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedInOpening: Rep: "Hey Maria, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Maria: "Yeah, I've got about 30 minutes. Fair warning - I've heard a lot of pitches over the years, so I'm probably more skeptical than your typical marketer. But happy to share what we're dealing with."Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"Maria: "I run a boutique agency - we're eight people, super lean. We work with mid-market DTC brands, mostly in the $5M-$50M revenue range. My role has shifted as we've grown. I'm less hands-on with campaigns now, more focused on client relationships, new business, and making sure my team has what they need. But I still jump into the weeds when there's a crisis or a big client needs attention."Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"Maria: "We've gotten really good at creative production - that's become our main differentiator. Most agencies just run ads, but we produce all our clients' creative in-house now. That's been huge for retention and results. We've also finally systematized our onboarding process, so we can get new clients live in under two weeks instead of a month. And honestly, business is good - we've had to turn away clients because we're at capacity."Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"Maria: "Hiring and retention is brutal. Everyone wants remote work, top agencies poach our best people, and training new media buyers takes forever. We've also hit some scaling challenges - at 25 clients, we're starting to feel operational strain. And client expectations keep going up while platform performance is getting harder. Everyone wants TikTok-level results on Facebook budgets. It's exhausting."Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges running an agency right now?"Maria: "Look, I'll be direct. Three things. One, margin pressure. Clients want more for less, platforms are more expensive, and we can't raise prices fast enough to keep up. Two, operational efficiency. We're spending way too much time on reporting and manual tasks instead of strategy. Three, talent. Finding, training, and keeping good people is the hardest part of this business."Rep: "You mentioned reporting takes too much time. Can you elaborate?"Maria: "Every client wants custom reports. Some want weekly, some want daily. Different formats, different metrics. My team probably spends 25-30% of their time just pulling data and making decks. We've tried to standardize, but clients push back - 'this is how we like to see the data.' So we're stuck doing custom work for everyone. It's death by a thousand cuts on our margins."Rep: "Walk me through a recent situation that highlighted these pain points."Maria: "Last month, one of our senior media buyers gave two weeks notice - got an offer from a bigger agency with 30% more money. We scrambled to redistribute her clients to other team members, but everyone was already maxed out. So I had to jump back into execution mode, running campaigns for three clients while trying to hire her replacement. We got behind on reporting, a client complained, and the whole thing was a mess for a month. That's agency life - you're always one person away from chaos."Rep: "When you're evaluating new tools, what's your process?"Maria: "Honestly? I'm really picky. We've tried tons of tools over the years and most either don't work as advertised, don't integrate with our stack, or have terrible support. Now I'm very cautious. I need to see proof it'll save us real time or make us real money. I don't care about shiny features - I care about ROI. And it needs to be easy enough that my team will actually use it, not just me."Rep: "What tools are you currently using across the agency?"Maria: "Ad platforms obviously - Meta, Google, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn depending on client. We use Supermetrics to pull data into Google Sheets and Looker Studio. Slack for internal comms. ClickUp for project management. We've tried probably five different reporting tools but none stuck - always something broken or missing. So we're back to Google Sheets and manual work, which sucks but at least it's reliable."Rep: "Where do you feel platforms are letting you down?"Maria: "Creative fatigue is a huge problem that platforms aren't solving. We'll have an ad working great, then performance falls off a cliff. The platforms just keep spending - they don't proactively alert us or automatically refresh creative. We have to manually monitor everything. Also, their automation is too aggressive - Advantage+ campaigns will blow through budgets or shift spend to garbage placements. We've had to build our own monitoring systems to catch issues before they cost clients money."Rep: "How much of your team's time goes to tasks you wish were automated?"Maria: "If I'm being honest, probably 40% of our billable hours are stuff that should be automated. Pulling reports, QA-ing campaigns, checking for broken tracking, budget pacing, moving data between systems. That's basically three full-time people on my team just doing manual operational work. If we could automate even half of that, it would transform our margins and give us capacity to take on more clients."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you handling attribution for your clients?"Maria: "It's our biggest ongoing challenge. We use Triple Whale for some clients, Northbeam for others, and some clients want us to use their internal attribution. The problem is all three give different numbers, and clients don't understand why. We spend so much time in meetings explaining attribution methodology instead of talking strategy. And honestly, post-iOS 14, all attribution is somewhat directional anyway. We're making educated guesses more than we'd like to admit."Rep: "What do your clients care most about?"Maria: "Depends on the client. Some are obsessed with ROAS - they want to see 3x or 4x and don't care about anything else. Some care more about new customer acquisition cost. The more sophisticated ones understand blended metrics and incrementality. But across the board, everyone wants growth. They hired us to drive revenue, and if we're not growing their business, nothing else matters."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could redesign your agency operations from scratch, what would you change?"Maria: "I'd build everything around minimizing manual work. Unified dashboard where we see all clients' performance. Automated reporting that clients can access anytime. Smart alerts that catch issues before they become expensive. And honestly, better client education tools - something that helps clients understand what good performance actually looks like so we're not constantly defending our results."Rep: "What would make you willing to pay for a new tool?"Maria: "Show me it'll save my team 10+ hours per week, or show me it'll improve client results by 20%+, and I'll pay almost any reasonable price. Time and performance are the only things I care about. I don't care about features or integrations or fancy dashboards. I care about ROI. If you can prove your tool makes us more profitable, I'm in."Rep: "Where do you see the biggest opportunities for agencies like yours?"Maria: "Honestly, in creative production and strategy. As platforms get more automated, the technical media buying work becomes less valuable. What clients need is great creative and smart strategic thinking. If tools can handle the operational grunt work, we can focus entirely on creative and strategy, which is where we actually add value. That's the future I want - my team thinks, creates, and strategizes. The tools handle execution."Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful Ñ thank you for being so candid. Just to recap, I heard operational efficiency and reducing manual work, talent challenges, and margin pressure are your top concerns. Sound right?"Maria: "Yeah. And look, if you're building something, make sure it actually works and solves a real problem. There's so much marketing tech that sounds good but doesn't deliver. Focus on something specific that saves real time or makes real money. Don't try to boil the ocean."Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"Maria: "Sure, but I'm going to be a tough critic. Show me proof it works, not just promises."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Boutique agency, 8 people, 25 clients, $3M annual spend* Top 3 Pains: (1) 40% of team time on manual operational work, (2) Talent acquisition and retention, (3) Margin pressure from reporting overhead* Tools Used: Meta, Google, TikTok, Supermetrics, Looker Studio, ClickUp, Triple Whale/Northbeam* Workarounds: Manual Google Sheets reporting, custom reports for each client, owner jumping into execution during crises* Key Quotes: "Always one person away from chaos", "Show me proof not promises", "Time and performance are the only things I care about"* Emotional Energy: Skeptical but pragmatic, burnt out on shiny tools that don't deliver* Follow-up: Yes, but needs strong proof of valueConversation 8: Affiliate Marketing ManagerProfile:* Role: Affiliate Marketing Manager at comparison/review site* Experience: 6 years in affiliate/performance marketing* Manages: $200K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Google, Microsoft Ads, native ad networks (Taboola, Outbrain)Opening: Rep: "Hey Chris, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Chris: "Sure, yeah. Affiliate is a pretty unique space though - very different economics than brand advertising."Warm-Up: Rep: "Totally understand. Tell me about your business and what you do day-to-day?"Chris: "We run a comparison site in the finance vertical - credit cards, loans, that kind of thing. We make money when people click through to our partners and convert. My job is driving traffic profitably. Day-to-day is pretty data-heavy - checking conversion rates by partner, optimizing bids, testing landing pages, and a lot of spreadsheet work calculating margins because our payouts vary by partner and traffic source."Rep: "What's working well right now?"Chris: "Google Search is still our bread and butter - people searching for 'best credit cards' have high intent and convert well. We've also figured out Microsoft Ads - way cheaper than Google and surprisingly good volume. Native ads are hit or miss, but when we find the right content angle, the ROI can be great."Rep: "What's been tough?"Chris: "Google keeps cracking down on affiliate sites with quality updates. We've had to invest way more in content to stay ranked. CPCs keep going up. And partner payouts are getting squeezed - what used to pay $200 per lead now pays $150. So our margins are getting thinner from both sides."Deep Dive: Rep: "What's your biggest challenge right now?"Chris: "Profitability math. I need to know in real-time if traffic is profitable. We're buying clicks at $3-5 each, driving them to landing pages, hoping they convert. But conversions happen on the partner's site, and we don't get that data for days or weeks. By the time I know a campaign isn't profitable, I've already spent thousands. It's like driving blind."Rep: "How do you handle that lag in conversion data?"Chris: "We've built predictive models based on click-through rate, time on site, and other engagement metrics. If CTR to partner is above X%, we assume it'll be profitable. But it's imperfect. We also do a ton of post-hoc analysis - pulling conversion data from partners, matching it back to our traffic sources, calculating actual ROI. It's super manual."Rep: "What does that post-hoc analysis process look like?"Chris: "Every Monday I download conversion reports from like 15 different partners - they all have different formats, different IDs, different attribution windows. Then I'm matching those conversions back to our Google Analytics data to figure out which traffic source drove them. Then calculating margin after partner payout and ad cost. The whole process takes most of the day. And by the time I have the answer, it's a week old."Rep: "That sounds painful. What have you tried to improve it?"Chris: "We've looked at attribution platforms, but they're expensive and built for e-commerce, not affiliate. We've tried building our own dashboards, but our engineering team is small and it's not their priority. So we're stuck with manual work. It is what it is."Rep: "How do you think about testing and optimization?"Chris: "Everything is ROI-driven. We test new traffic sources with small budgets, measure conversion rates and payouts, calculate break-even, then scale if it's profitable. Same with landing page tests - we'll run A/B tests to improve conversion rate to partner. The challenge is we need a lot of volume to reach statistical significance, and that can be expensive."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How do you approach attribution in affiliate?"Chris: "Pretty simple - last-click mostly. If someone clicks our ad, lands on our site, clicks through to a partner, and converts, we get credit. But partners sometimes have their own attribution that conflicts with ours. Like, we'll show we drove 100 conversions, but they'll only credit us for 80. Then we're arguing with partner managers about attribution methodology."Rep: "What metrics do you optimize for?"Chris: "Revenue per click is the ultimate metric. I can spend on any traffic source as long as I'm making more than I spend. So I'm constantly calculating: cost per click, click-through rate to partner, conversion rate on partner site, average payout per conversion. That gives me revenue per click. If it's positive, I scale. If it's negative, I cut."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "What would transform how you work?"Chris: "Real-time profitability data. I want to see which campaigns are actually making money right now, not a week later. That would let me scale winners and kill losers way faster. Also, automated partner integrations so I'm not manually downloading CSVs from 15 different dashboards every week."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Super helpful. Sounds like real-time profitability visibility and automated partner data integration are your main pain points?"Chris: "Yeah, exactly. Anything that gets me to ROI data faster is valuable."Rep: "Would you be open to seeing what we build?"Chris: "Sure, hit me up when you have something."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Finance comparison site, affiliate model* Top 3 Pains: (1) Delayed conversion data from partners, (2) Manual weekly ROI analysis from multiple sources, (3) Margin pressure from rising CPCs and lower payouts* Tools Used: Google Ads, Microsoft Ads, Taboola, Outbrain, Google Analytics, Excel* Workarounds: Predictive models based on engagement, Monday CSV downloads from 15 partners* Key Quotes: "Driving blind", "It is what it is", "Revenue per click is the ultimate metric"* Emotional Energy: Resigned to manual work, pragmatic about limitations* Follow-up: YesConversation 9: App Subscription Growth LeadProfile:* Role: Head of Growth at meditation app* Experience: 7 years in consumer apps* Manages: $300K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Google UAC, TikTok, Apple Search Ads, SnapchatOpening: Rep: "Hey Priya, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Priya: "Yes! I'm always happy to talk shop. Growth marketing is such a fast-moving space."Warm-Up: Rep: "Love it. Tell me about your role and what you're working on?"Priya: "I lead growth for a meditation and mental wellness app. We have a freemium model - free content with a premium subscription. My main job is acquiring users who'll convert to paid subscribers and stick around. We're competing with Calm and Headspace, so it's a pretty competitive space. I've got a team of three - one focused on creative, two on media buying and analysis."Rep: "What's your day-to-day like?"Priya: "Mornings I review overnight performance - we run global campaigns so there's always data to check. Then I'm in our analytics tools looking at cohort performance - which acquisition sources drive subscribers who retain? We have weekly creative sprints where we test new concepts. And I spend a lot of time with our product team because conversion to paid happens in-app, so UA and product need to be aligned."Rep: "What's been going really well?"Priya: "TikTok has been amazing for us - the content style fits our brand perfectly. We've also nailed our onboarding flow - we're converting 15% of free users to paid within the first week, which is really strong. And our retention is trending up, which gives us more room to spend on acquisition. Our CEO is happy because we're growing."Rep: "Any challenges?"Priya: "Yeah, definitely. Competition is intense - CPMs have doubled in the last 18 months. We're also in a saturated category - everyone and their mom has launched a wellness app. Finding differentiation in our ads is tough. And honestly, predicting LTV is hard because retention curves are so variable. Some cohorts look great at Day 7 then fall off at Day 90."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me more about the LTV prediction challenge."Priya: "Sure. When I'm buying installs today, I need to know if those users will be worth it over their lifetime. But lifetime takes months or years to observe. So we use predictive models - we look at Day 7 engagement, Day 30 retention, trial-to-paid conversion rates, and try to predict 12-month LTV. But our models are only like 70% accurate. So we're constantly making bet decisions on imperfect data."Rep: "How does that impact your optimization approach?"Priya: "It makes us conservative. We probably under-spend because we're not confident in our predictions. Like, we have campaigns that look great on Day 7 metrics, but I'm hesitant to scale because I don't trust the LTV forecast. If I had more confidence in the numbers, I'd spend more aggressively. But I can't afford to burn a bunch of money on users who churn in month two."Rep: "What's your creative testing process?"Priya: "We produce probably 30-40 new ad variants per month - mix of UGC-style testimonials, feature demos, and lifestyle content. We launch them across Meta and TikTok with small budgets, see which ones drive good CPI and engagement, then scale winners. The challenge is creative fatigues fast - a winning ad might be dead in three weeks. So we're on this treadmill of constantly producing new content."Rep: "How are you measuring success beyond just installs?"Priya: "We track the full funnel - installs, trial starts, trial-to-paid conversion, retention at 30/60/90 days, and ultimately LTV:CAC ratio. Our north star is profitable subscriber acquisition. We're not optimizing for vanity metrics like downloads - we care about subscribers who pay and stick around."Rep: "What tools are you using to track all of that?"Priya: "Adjust for attribution, Amplitude for product analytics, Looker for BI. Ad platforms for campaign management. We've built a bunch of custom dashboards in Looker that connect all the data sources. It's not perfect - there's always data discrepancies between systems - but it's functional."Rep: "Where do you spend the most manual effort?"Priya: "Honestly, creative production and deployment. We're shooting videos, editing them, exporting in different formats for each platform, uploading to ad managers, creating campaigns, tracking performance. It's so manual. I wish there was a way to upload one concept and have it automatically reformatted and deployed across platforms. We also spend a ton of time analyzing cohorts - pulling user data, segmenting by acquisition source, calculating LTV. That's super manual too."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality?"Priya: "We've run a few geo holdout tests to measure incrementality. The results were... humbling. Turns out maybe 60-70% of our attributed installs would have happened organically anyway. So our true incremental CPI is way higher than we thought. Now we're trying to figure out how to optimize for incremental installs, not just attributed installs, but the data is messy."Rep: "That's a tough realization. How did it change your approach?"Priya: "Made us more skeptical of platform attribution. Now we focus more on experiments and holdout tests. We also shifted some budget to brand awareness campaigns that might not have great direct attribution but drive overall growth. And we're investing more in organic channels - SEO, ASO, content - because those are truly incremental."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could snap your fingers and change one thing, what would it be?"Priya: "Accurate LTV prediction on Day 1. If I could know with 90%+ confidence whether a user will be valuable long-term based on their first day of behavior, I could optimize so much better. Right now I'm flying blind for weeks or months before I know if my spending was smart."Rep: "What else would make your life easier?"Priya: "Creative workflow automation for sure. The production to deployment pipeline is so inefficient. And better cross-platform campaign management - I shouldn't have to manually build the same campaign three times. Also, I'd love AI-powered creative testing that tells me why certain ads work, not just which ones work."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This has been great. Sounds like LTV prediction, creative workflow automation, and incrementality measurement are your key challenges?"Priya: "Exactly. Those are the things keeping me up at night."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're building when it's ready?"Priya: "Absolutely! I'm always excited about tools that could help us grow faster."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Meditation app, freemium model, competing with Calm/Headspace* Top 3 Pains: (1) Early LTV prediction accuracy (currently 70%), (2) Creative production/deployment workflow, (3) Incrementality measurement* Tools Used: Meta, Google UAC, TikTok, Apple Search Ads, Adjust, Amplitude, Looker* Workarounds: Conservative spending due to LTV uncertainty, custom Looker dashboards* Key Quotes: "Making bet decisions on imperfect data", "60-70% would have happened organically anyway", "Creative fatigues fast"* Emotional Energy: Energetic and growth-minded, frustrated by data limitations* Follow-up: Yes, very interestedConversation 10: Education/Online Course MarketerProfile:* Role: Marketing Director at online education platform* Experience: 8 years in ed-tech marketing* Manages: $150K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, YouTubeOpening: Rep: "Hey David, thanks for making time. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"David: "Works for me. Online education has some unique challenges compared to other industries, but happy to share."Warm-Up: Rep: "Great. Can you give me an overview of your business and what you do?"David: "We're an online platform offering professional certification courses - think project management, data science, business analysis. Courses range from $500 to $3,000. I run all our paid acquisition. We have a long consideration cycle - people research for weeks before buying. My typical day is split between optimizing campaigns, working with our content team on webinars and lead magnets, and analyzing which lead sources actually convert to paid enrollments."Rep: "What's going well?"David: "LinkedIn has been solid for professional courses - we can target by job title and industry. Our webinar funnel is converting really well - we drive people to free webinars, then pitch the course. YouTube is growing for us too. And we've finally gotten good at email nurture - people who don't buy immediately get a 60-day nurture sequence that converts 8-10%."Rep: "What's challenging?"David: "The long sales cycle makes optimization really hard. Someone clicks an ad today, attends a webinar next week, gets nurtured for a month, then buys. By the time they convert, I've forgotten which campaign they came from. Attribution is a nightmare. Also, education is a discretionary purchase - when the economy is uncertain, our conversions drop. We can't control that."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me more about the attribution challenges with a long sales cycle."David: "Sure. Let's say someone clicks a Facebook ad on January 1st, downloads a lead magnet, gets added to our email list, attends a webinar on January 15th, then buys the course on February 10th. Which channel gets credit? Facebook says it's them because they drove the initial click. Our email team says it's them because the emails nurtured the lead. The webinar team says it's them because that's where the pitch happened. Everyone's fighting over credit, and I don't have a good answer."Rep: "How are you handling that today?"David: "Multi-touch attribution in theory, but it's not perfect. We use HubSpot to track the customer journey and give fractional credit to each touchpoint. But there are gaps - if someone sees a Facebook ad on their phone, then later comes back on desktop via Google search, we lose the connection. So our attribution is directional at best. We also look at cohort analysis - we track groups of leads by source and see which sources ultimately drive revenue."Rep: "Walk me through your funnel - how do people go from ad to purchase?"David: "We run ads driving to lead magnets - free checklists, templates, webinar registrations. The ad says 'Download our free guide to becoming a project manager.' They give us their email. Then we nurture them with educational content - 'here's how to pass the PMP exam,' 'here's what project managers earn.' We invite them to webinars where we demonstrate the value of our courses. During or after the webinar, we pitch the course with a time-limited discount. Some buy immediately, others take weeks to decide."Rep: "What's the biggest bottleneck in that funnel?"David: "Webinar attendance. We can drive leads cheaply - like $20-30 per lead. But only 30-40% actually show up to the webinar. And of those who show up, maybe 2-3% buy. So the real cost per customer is more like $3,000-4,000. If we could improve show-up rates or close rates, our unit economics would improve dramatically."Rep: "How much manual work goes into managing this funnel?"David: "A lot. I'm manually tagging leads by source in HubSpot. Creating audience segments for different nurture paths. Building campaign workflows. Tracking who attended webinars and manually following up with them. Pulling reports to see which lead sources are converting downstream. It's operationally intensive."Rep: "What platforms and tools are you using?"David: "Facebook and Google for top of funnel. LinkedIn for targeting specific professional audiences. YouTube for content and ads. HubSpot is our CRM and marketing automation platform - that's where all our nurture lives. Zoom for webinars. Google Analytics for website tracking. And a bunch of spreadsheets to connect everything."Rep: "How much time are you spending on reporting and analysis?"David: "Probably 15-20 hours per week. I'm pulling ad platform data, matching it to HubSpot leads, tracking which leads attended webinars, seeing which ones ultimately enrolled. Then creating reports for our exec team showing ROI by channel. It's tedious, and frankly the data is never as clean as I want it to be."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you measuring success?"David: "Ultimately, cost per enrollment and LTV:CAC ratio. But those are lagging indicators - I might not know for 60-90 days if a campaign was successful. So I also track leading indicators - cost per lead, lead-to-MQL conversion rate, webinar attendance rate, webinar-to-purchase rate. I'm constantly trying to predict which early metrics indicate downstream success."Rep: "What's your approach to testing?"David: "We test everything - ad creative, landing pages, lead magnets, email subject lines, webinar content. But testing takes time because of the long cycle. If I test two Facebook campaigns today, I won't know which one drove more enrollments for two months. So we try to focus on tests that give us early signals - like which ad has better CTR or which landing page has better conversion to lead."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "What would change the game for you?"David: "Better attribution that actually captures the full journey. Right now I'm stitching together data from multiple sources and making educated guesses. If I had a system that tracked someone from first touchpoint to final purchase and showed me the full path, I could make way better decisions about budget allocation. Also, automated lead scoring - if AI could predict which leads are likely to convert based on behavior, we could focus our energy there."Rep: "Anything else?"David: "Honestly, just less manual work. The amount of time I spend tagging leads, creating segments, pulling reports - that should be automated. I should be focused on strategy, not data entry."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Super helpful. So attribution across a long sales cycle, automating lead management, and reducing manual reporting are your main pain points?"David: "Yeah, that sums it up. Anything that helps us understand what's actually driving enrollments would be huge."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing what we build?"David: "Definitely. I'm always looking for better solutions."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Online education platform, $500-$3K courses, long sales cycle* Top 3 Pains: (1) Attribution across multi-touch, 60-90 day customer journey, (2) Manual lead tagging and segmentation in HubSpot, (3) Predicting which early signals indicate downstream success* Tools Used: Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, YouTube, HubSpot, Zoom, GA, Excel* Workarounds: Manual lead tagging, cohort analysis, fractional multi-touch attribution* Key Quotes: "By the time they convert, I've forgotten which campaign they came from", "Attribution is directional at best", "Real cost per customer is $3-4K"* Emotional Energy: Analytical, process-oriented, frustrated by data gaps* Follow-up: YesConversation 11: Healthcare Practice Marketing CoordinatorProfile:* Role: Marketing Coordinator at dental practice group (8 locations)* Experience: 2 years in healthcare marketing* Manages: $25K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Google Local Services, Google Search, FacebookOpening: Rep: "Hey Lisa, thanks for taking the time. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Lisa: "Sure, though I should mention I'm still pretty new to this role and to marketing in general."Warm-Up: Rep: "No problem at all. Tell me about your job and what you're responsible for."Lisa: "I handle marketing for eight dental offices across the region. My job is filling appointment slots - new patients mainly, but also existing patients coming back for cleanings or procedures. I run Google and Facebook ads, manage our social media, coordinate with our front desk staff on booking, and track which marketing efforts are bringing in patients."Rep: "What does a typical day look like?"Lisa: "Mornings I check our appointment booking system to see how many new patients scheduled yesterday. Then I check our ads to make sure they're running and spending properly. I respond to Facebook messages and reviews - patients message us all the time. I coordinate with our dentists on promotions or new services to advertise. It's a lot of multitasking."Rep: "What's working well?"Lisa: "Google Local Services has been great - we pay per call and the quality is good. People searching for 'dentist near me' are ready to book. Facebook has been hit or miss, but it works for awareness. And our reviews are strong, which helps a lot when people are researching us."Rep: "What's been difficult?"Lisa: "Honestly, I feel a bit in over my head sometimes. I didn't come from a marketing background - I was a dental assistant before this. So I'm learning as I go. Tracking what's working is confusing. And our doctors keep asking me questions I don't know how to answer, like 'what's our cost per patient' or 'which location is performing best.' I'm figuring it out, but it's stressful."Deep Dive: Rep: "Let's talk about tracking. What's confusing about it?"Lisa: "Well, someone might see our Facebook ad, then later Google us, then call. Which marketing channel do I credit? We use call tracking numbers, so I can see which phone number they called, but sometimes people call the main number they found on our website instead of the tracking number. And then I don't know where they came from."Rep: "How are you managing campaigns across eight locations?"Lisa: "It's a lot. Each location has its own Google Ads campaign and Facebook ads targeting their local area. I'm basically managing eight different ad accounts. When I want to make a change - like updating our promotion - I have to go into each campaign and update it manually. It takes forever."Rep: "What would make your job easier?"Lisa: "Honestly, I just need things to be simpler. I'm not an expert, so I need tools that are straightforward. And I need better reporting - something I can show the doctors that makes sense. Right now I'm pulling numbers from Google, Facebook, and our appointment system, and trying to explain it all in a PowerPoint. It's a mess."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand, what would help you most?"Lisa: "A simple dashboard that shows: here's how many people called from ads, here's how many booked appointments, here's how much we spent, here's our cost per new patient. All in one place, for all eight locations. Something I can look at daily without getting overwhelmed. And maybe training resources or support - I'm learning this stuff on the fly and could use more help."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This is really helpful. Sounds like simplified reporting, easier multi-location management, and better tracking are your main needs?"Lisa: "Yeah, exactly. I just want to feel more confident that I'm doing this right."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing tools that could help?"Lisa: "For sure. I'm open to anything that makes this easier."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Dental practice group, 8 locations, relatively new marketer* Top 3 Pains: (1) Tracking and attribution across touchpoints, (2) Managing 8 location campaigns manually, (3) Simple, clear reporting for non-marketer* Tools Used: Google LSA, Google Search, Facebook, call tracking, appointment system* Workarounds: Manual updates across 8 campaigns, basic PowerPoint reports* Key Quotes: "I feel in over my head", "Learning as I go", "Which channel do I credit?"* Emotional Energy: Overwhelmed, eager to learn, needs simplicity* Follow-up: YesConversation 12: Real Estate Marketing DirectorProfile:* Role: Marketing Director at luxury real estate brokerage* Experience: 9 years in real estate marketing* Manages: $80K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Google, Zillow, Realtor.comOpening: Rep: "Hey Amanda, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Amanda: "Perfect timing actually - we're in the middle of planning our Q2 strategy. Happy to chat."Warm-Up: Rep: "Great. Tell me about your business and role."Amanda: "I'm the marketing director for a luxury real estate brokerage. We have about 40 agents selling high-end properties - think $2M+ homes. My job is generating buyer and seller leads for our agents. We do a mix of brand building and direct response. I also manage our agents' personal marketing - they each have their own budgets and want support."Rep: "What's a typical week look like?"Amanda: "Mondays I meet with our top agents to review their lead flow and plan their campaigns. Rest of the week I'm managing our brokerage-level campaigns, coordinating property listing ads, working with our photographer and content creator, and trying to balance brand awareness with lead generation. Real estate is relationship-driven, so we're not just running ads - we're building reputation."Rep: "What's working well?"Amanda: "Instagram has been phenomenal for luxury properties - the visual storytelling really works. Facebook lead ads are driving decent volume. And our agents' personal brands are strong - when they post content, it performs well. We've also gotten good at virtual tours and video content, which accelerated during COVID and stuck around."Rep: "What's challenging?"Amanda: "Real estate sales cycles are long and unpredictable. Someone might inquire today and buy two years from now. So measuring ROI on ad spend is really hard. We're also balancing brokerage marketing with individual agent marketing - everyone wants budget and attention. And honestly, the market itself - interest rates, inventory, buyer sentiment - impacts our results more than our marketing does."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me more about the long sales cycle challenge."Amanda: "A lead comes in - maybe they fill out a form on a Facebook ad. An agent follows up. Maybe they tour some properties. But they might not be ready to buy for 6 months or 12 months. Then when they do buy, how do I know if it was because of that original Facebook ad, or because of the agent's follow-up, or because of our brand reputation? Attribution is basically impossible."Rep: "How do you approach measurement then?"Amanda: "We track lead volume and lead quality - our agents tell us which leads are actually qualified. We look at close rates over time. And we do brand awareness surveys in our market to see if we're top of mind. But connecting specific ad dollars to closed deals? That's more art than science. We mostly trust that if we're generating quality leads and our agents are closing them, we're doing our job."Rep: "You mentioned balancing brokerage and agent marketing. How does that work?"Amanda: "The brokerage has a marketing budget for brand and recruitment. Individual agents have their own budgets for their personal marketing. My team supports both. But agents all want different things - some want Facebook ads for buyer leads, some want Instagram for brand building, some want Google ads for their name. Coordinating all of that while maintaining brand consistency is like herding cats."Rep: "What tools are you using?"Amanda: "Meta for Facebook and Instagram. Google Ads for search. We advertise on Zillow and Realtor.com. We use a CRM called Follow Up Boss for lead management. Canva for quick graphics. And honestly, a lot of our agents use their own tools - some have their own websites, their own email systems. It's fragmented."Rep: "Where do you spend the most time?"Amanda: "Probably on agent management and content creation. Every property listing needs photos, video, copy, ads across multiple platforms. That's time-intensive. I also spend a lot of time in lead quality conversations - an agent will say 'these Facebook leads suck,' and I have to dig into why and adjust targeting or messaging. It's very hands-on."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How do you think about brand awareness versus direct response?"Amanda: "It's a constant tension. Our CEO wants leads - he wants to see form fills and phone calls. But I know that in luxury real estate, brand matters. People buy from agents they trust and brands they recognize. So I push for budget on brand campaigns even though the ROI is harder to prove. It's a political battle sometimes."Rep: "What would better measurement look like for you?"Amanda: "Honestly, I'd love to be able to track someone's full journey - they see our brand ads, later they search for us, they visit our website, they inquire on a property, an agent follows up, they eventually close. If I could see that whole path and say 'this lead that closed started with a brand campaign six months ago,' that would be powerful. Right now, those connections are invisible."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could change one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Amanda: "Easier agent coordination. Right now I'm manually managing 40 different agents' needs and campaigns. If there was a system where agents could self-serve some of their marketing needs - like easily launch their own listing ads within brand guidelines - that would free up so much of my time. I'd rather focus on strategy than tactical execution for every single agent."Rep: "What else would help?"Amanda: "Better lead quality scoring. If we could predict which leads are actually going to transact based on their behavior and profile, we could prioritize those. Right now every lead gets treated the same, and agents waste time on tire kickers."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This has been great. Sounds like long sales cycle attribution, agent coordination, and lead quality assessment are your key challenges?"Amanda: "Exactly. Real estate marketing is complex because of the human relationships involved."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're working on when it's ready?"Amanda: "Sure, I'm always interested in better tools."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Luxury real estate brokerage, 40 agents, $2M+ properties* Top 3 Pains: (1) Attribution across long, unpredictable sales cycles, (2) Coordinating marketing for 40 agents with individual needs, (3) Lead quality prediction and scoring* Tools Used: Facebook, Instagram, Google, Zillow, Realtor.com, Follow Up Boss, Canva* Workarounds: Qualitative feedback from agents on lead quality, brand awareness surveys* Key Quotes: "Attribution is basically impossible", "Herding cats", "More art than science"* Emotional Energy: Strategic but politically challenged, needs better agent management tools* Follow-up: YesI'll continue with the remaining 8 conversations. Let me create more variety in tone, length, and perspectives.Conversation 13: Political Campaign Digital DirectorProfile:* Role: Digital Director for congressional campaign* Experience: 5 years in political marketing* Manages: $400K total campaign budget (6-month race), $60K/month in final stretch* Platforms: Meta, Google, YouTube, email/SMSOpening: Rep: "Hey Jordan, thanks for making time - I know you're in the middle of a campaign. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Jordan: "Yeah, I've got 20 minutes. Let's make it quick - I'm literally launching ads in an hour for a debate response."Warm-Up: Rep: "Totally understand. Give me the quick version - what's your role?"Jordan: "I run all digital for a congressional race. Fundraising, persuasion, GOTV. We have six months to raise money, move voters, and win. It's high-pressure, fast-paced, and everything we do is public - if our ad sucks, Twitter will let us know in about 30 seconds."Rep: "What's working?"Jordan: "Small-dollar fundraising on Meta is crushing it. We're raising $10 for every $1 we spend. Our rapid response is good - when news breaks, we can have ads live within hours. And our email program is strong - we have a consultant who's a genius at subject lines."Rep: "What's tough?"Jordan: "We're always out-spent by dark money groups. Also, creative fatigue is brutal - we need fresh content constantly but our candidate's time is limited. And honestly, the stakes are really high. If I mess up our ad spend in the final week, we could lose. No pressure, right?"Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me about your rapid response process."Jordan: "Okay, so let's say our opponent says something stupid at a debate. Within 30 minutes, my team clips the video, writes copy, designs graphics, and we're launching ads on Meta and Twitter. Speed matters in politics - first mover advantage is real. But it's chaotic. I'm approving creative while our candidate is literally still on stage."Rep: "That sounds intense. What makes it hard?"Jordan: "Legal and compliance review. Every ad needs legal approval because of FEC rules - disclaimers, disclosures, all that. But legal review takes time, and in rapid response situations, we don't have time. So we've built templates that are pre-approved, but they're limiting. Also, Meta's ad review can be unpredictable - sometimes our ads get rejected for vague policy reasons and we have to appeal."Rep: "How are you balancing fundraising versus persuasion versus GOTV?"Jordan: "It shifts over the campaign. Right now we're heavy on fundraising because we need money. Closer to Election Day, we'll shift to persuasion and GOTV. But it's also audience-dependent - our base gets fundraising asks, swing voters get persuasion, and our volunteer list gets GOTV. We're running like 15 different campaigns simultaneously targeting different groups."Rep: "What's your data and targeting approach?"Jordan: "We have a voter file with scores - persuadability scores, turnout scores, issue priority scores. We upload those to Meta and Google as custom audiences. But the match rates are terrible - maybe 40-50%. So we're reaching a bunch of people who aren't even voters. We also use TV data and other third-party data. But honestly, political targeting post-iOS 14 is way harder than it used to be."Rep: "How are you measuring success?"Jordan: "Depends on the objective. Fundraising is easy - did we raise more than we spent? Persuasion is harder - we use polling and survey data to see if our ads are moving numbers. GOTV is measured by turnout. But connecting specific ads to votes is impossible. We can see directional trends, but there's so much noise - earned media, our opponent's ads, national political environment."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "What would change the game for you?"Jordan: "Real-time polling integrated with ad platforms. I want to see which messages are actually moving voters, not just which ads have good engagement rates. Also, faster creative production - we should be able to generate and test 50 ad variants per week, not 10. And honestly, better compliance automation - legal review is a bottleneck."Rep: "Anything else?"Jordan: "Look, political campaigns are six-month sprints with zero room for error. Any tool that saves us time or helps us make smarter decisions faster is valuable. But it needs to work out of the box - we don't have time for lengthy onboarding or customization."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Super helpful. Sounds like rapid response speed, creative production at scale, and compliance workflow are key pain points?"Jordan: "Yeah. And just generally the chaos of running 15 campaigns at once with limited resources."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing what we're building?"Jordan: "Maybe, but I'll be honest - after this campaign I might never do this again. It's exhausting. But sure, reach out after Election Day."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Congressional campaign, 6-month race, $400K budget* Top 3 Pains: (1) Rapid response speed bottlenecked by compliance review, (2) Creative production volume - need 50+ variants/week, (3) Targeting accuracy - 40-50% match rates on voter file* Tools Used: Meta, Google, YouTube, Voter file/CRM, third-party data providers* Workarounds: Pre-approved creative templates for rapid response, simultaneous campaign management* Key Quotes: "If I mess up the final week, we could lose", "No time for lengthy onboarding", "Chaos of running 15 campaigns at once"* Emotional Energy: Intense, high-pressure, time-sensitive, slightly burnt out* Follow-up: Maybe after electionConversation 14: Non-Profit Fundraising Marketing ManagerProfile:* Role: Digital Marketing Manager at environmental non-profit* Experience: 4 years in non-profit marketing* Manages: $50K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Google Grants, YouTubeOpening: Rep: "Hey Elena, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Elena: "Yes, absolutely. I'm always interested in hearing about new tools, especially if they're affordable for non-profits."Warm-Up: Rep: "Great. Tell me about your organization and what you do."Elena: "We're an environmental conservation non-profit focused on ocean protection. I handle our digital fundraising and awareness campaigns. My main KPI is donor acquisition and retention - we need recurring monthly donors to sustain our programs. I work with a small team - it's me, a content creator, and we have a consultant who helps with email. We're lean."Rep: "What does your day look like?"Elena: "Mornings I check donation numbers from overnight - did our campaigns drive donations? Then I'm managing our Meta and YouTube campaigns, coordinating with our programs team on storytelling content, writing emails to our donor list, and analyzing what's resonating. Non-profit marketing is very mission-driven - we're trying to inspire people to care and contribute."Rep: "What's working well?"Elena: "Meta has been our best channel for donor acquisition. We run video ads showing the impact of our work - sea turtles being released, coral reef restoration - and it's emotionally compelling. Google Grants gives us $10K/month in free Google Ads, which is huge for our budget. And our email program has strong retention - people who donate once tend to stay engaged."Rep: "What's challenging?"Elena: "Budget is always tight - we're trying to maximize every dollar. Donor fatigue is real - people get asked for money constantly, so breaking through is hard. And honestly, proving ROI to our board is difficult. They understand brand awareness and mission impact, but they also want to see efficient cost per donor. It's a balance."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me about your fundraising campaigns. How do they work?"Elena: "We run a mix of always-on donor acquisition and campaign-based fundraising tied to events or urgent needs. For example, if there's a disaster affecting marine life, we'll launch an emergency campaign - 'help us respond.' Those perform really well because of the urgency. Then we have evergreen campaigns like 'become a monthly donor' that run continuously. The monthly donor campaigns are lower intensity but more valuable long-term."Rep: "How do you think about donor lifetime value?"Elena: "Monthly recurring donors are gold. If someone gives $25/month and stays for two years, that's $600. Way more valuable than a one-time $50 donation. So we're always trying to convert one-time donors to recurring. We use email nurture and retargeting to encourage that conversion."Rep: "What's your creative approach?"Elena: "Heavy on storytelling and emotional connection. We're not selling a product - we're selling a feeling and a mission. Our best ads show the tangible impact of donations - 'your $50 protects 100 square feet of coral reef.' We also feature beneficiaries - the animals we're protecting, the communities we're supporting. That authenticity matters."Rep: "How much time goes into reporting for your board?"Elena: "Too much, honestly. Every board meeting I'm presenting on donor acquisition cost, retention rates, campaign performance, overall fundraising trajectory. The board is financially-minded - they're donors themselves - so they scrutinize the numbers. I spend probably 10-12 hours per quarter just on board reporting. It's necessary but time-consuming."Rep: "What's your tech stack?"Elena: "Meta Business Manager, Google Ads (via Google Grants), YouTube. We use EveryAction as our CRM and donor management system - that's where all our donor data lives. Email is sent through EveryAction too. And we have Google Analytics on our website. Pretty simple setup."Rep: "Where do you wish you had more capability?"Elena: "A/B testing at scale. Right now we test maybe two creative variants per campaign because production is limited. If we could test 10 or 20 variants, we'd learn so much faster. Also, better donor data analysis - understanding which acquisition sources drive the best lifetime value, which messaging resonates with different donor segments. We have the data but not the time to analyze it deeply."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about donor attribution?"Elena: "Pretty straightforward - last touch mostly. If someone donates after clicking a Facebook ad, Facebook gets credit. But I know it's more complex - they probably saw our content multiple times, maybe got an email, saw organic posts. Multi-touch attribution would be more accurate, but we don't have the tools for that."Rep: "How do you balance donor acquisition with retention?"Elena: "It's about 70-30 - 70% of budget on acquisition, 30% on retention and reactivation. Acquisition is expensive - our cost per donor is $40-60. But retention is cheaper and more valuable. We've gotten better at nurturing new donors so they become recurring supporters."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could improve one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"Elena: "More sophisticated donor analytics. I want to know which acquisition channels drive donors who give the most over time. Which messaging converts one-time donors to monthly? Which donor segments are most likely to lapse? If I had those insights, I could optimize way better. Right now I'm mostly relying on gut instinct and basic metrics."Rep: "What else would help?"Elena: "Affordable tools designed for non-profits. A lot of marketing tech is priced for big companies. We can't afford $10K/month software. If there were tools built specifically for non-profit budgets and needs, that would be amazing."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This is really helpful. Sounds like donor LTV analysis, creative testing at scale, and affordable tools are your key needs?"Elena: "Exactly. Non-profits are resource-constrained, so efficiency and affordability are critical."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing what we're building, especially if we had non-profit pricing?"Elena: "Absolutely. I'm always looking for ways to stretch our budget further."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Environmental non-profit, ocean conservation focus* Top 3 Pains: (1) Donor LTV analysis - which sources drive best long-term value, (2) Creative testing at scale with limited production resources, (3) Affordable tools for non-profit budgets* Tools Used: Meta, Google Grants, YouTube, EveryAction (CRM), GA* Workarounds: Basic last-touch attribution, limited A/B testing (2 variants max)* Key Quotes: "Proving ROI to board is difficult", "We can't afford $10K/month software", "Storytelling and emotional connection"* Emotional Energy: Mission-driven, resource-conscious, eager for efficiency* Follow-up: Yes, especially if non-profit pricing availableConversation 15: Restaurant Group Marketing ManagerProfile:* Role: Marketing Manager at restaurant group (12 locations)* Experience: 3 years in restaurant marketing* Manages: $35K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Instagram, Google Local, YelpOpening: Rep: "Hey Carlos, thanks for chatting today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Carlos: "Yeah, cool. Restaurant marketing is kind of its own world, but let's do it."Warm-Up: Rep: "For sure. Give me the overview - what do you do?"Carlos: "I run marketing for a restaurant group - 12 locations across three cities, mix of casual dining concepts. My job is driving foot traffic and online orders. It's very local and very immediate - people decide where to eat the same day, sometimes the same hour. So we're constantly promoting specials, events, new menu items. It's fast-paced."Rep: "What's your day like?"Carlos: "Check reservations and online order volume from yesterday. Update our daily specials across all platforms. Respond to reviews and DMs - people reach out constantly with questions. Coordinate with our GMs on local promotions. Plan content - food photography, Instagram stories, whatever. And honestly, put out fires. Negative review? I'm responding. Kitchen delayed a catering order? I'm managing the customer."Rep: "What's working?"Carlos: "Instagram is huge for us - food is visual and people love sharing. Meta ads drive online orders. Google Maps is critical - when people search 'Italian restaurant near me,' we need to show up. And honestly, word of mouth and reviews are our best marketing. If our food and service are good, the marketing part is easier."Rep: "What sucks?"Carlos: "Restaurant margins are thin, so every marketing dollar matters. Competition is intense - there are five restaurants within a block of each location. And we're very dependent on external factors - weather, holidays, local events. If it rains, people don't go out. If there's a big game, everyone goes to sports bars. We can't control that."Deep Dive: Rep: "How are you managing marketing for 12 locations?"Carlos: "It's a mix of corporate-level campaigns and location-specific stuff. Corporate handles brand advertising and major promotions. But each location has its own vibe and customer base. The downtown location attracts happy hour crowds. The suburban location is all families. So I'm customizing messaging for each. It's a lot to juggle."Rep: "What does location-specific marketing look like?"Carlos: "Let's say one location is slow on Tuesday nights. I'll run Facebook ads targeting people within two miles, offering a Tuesday special. Or if a location is near a concert venue, I'll push ads on event nights. It's hyper-local and reactive. I'm basically running 12 mini-campaigns constantly."Rep: "How do you measure success?"Carlos: "Pretty simple - did people show up? Did online orders increase? We have POS data showing daily sales by location. We also track reservation volume and online order counts. If sales are up and I ran ads, I assume the ads helped. It's not sophisticated attribution, but restaurants are straightforward."Rep: "What platforms are you using?"Carlos: "Meta for ads and organic content. Instagram is huge. Google Business Profile for local search and reviews. Yelp because people use it even though we hate paying them. We also use Toast for POS and online ordering, so that's where our sales data lives."Rep: "What takes the most time?"Carlos: "Content creation and review management. We need fresh food photos constantly - people don't want to see the same burger pic over and over. So I'm coordinating with our chef, shooting photos, editing, posting. And reviews are non-stop - Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor. If someone leaves a bad review and we don't respond, it looks terrible. So I'm monitoring all day."Rep: "How much of your time is reactive versus strategic?"Carlos: "Honestly, like 70% reactive. I wish I had time for big strategic planning, but I'm too busy dealing with daily operations. Someone posts a complaint on Instagram? I'm responding. A location needs help with a slow night? I'm launching ads. I'm always in firefighting mode."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "What would make your life easier?"Carlos: "Automated content scheduling and review management. If I could batch create content once per week and have it automatically post at optimal times, that would save hours. And if there was a tool that aggregated all our reviews from different platforms and helped me respond faster, that would be clutch."Rep: "Anything else?"Carlos: "Better visibility into what's actually driving sales. Right now, if sales go up, I don't really know if it was my ads, organic traffic, a positive review, or just the weather. If I could see clearer cause and effect, I'd make better decisions."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Got it. Sounds like multi-location management, content and review automation, and better attribution are your main challenges?"Carlos: "Yeah. And honestly, just anything that frees up time. I'm stretched really thin."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're building?"Carlos: "Sure, if it's not crazy expensive. Restaurants don't have huge marketing budgets."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Restaurant group, 12 locations, casual dining* Top 3 Pains: (1) Multi-location campaign management (12 locations, each different), (2) Content creation and review management time sink, (3) Simple attribution - what's driving foot traffic and orders* Tools Used: Meta, Instagram, Google Business Profile, Yelp, Toast (POS)* Workarounds: Manual content creation and posting, reactive approach to marketing* Key Quotes: "70% reactive", "Can't control weather or local events", "Restaurants are straightforward"* Emotional Energy: Constantly firefighting, needs time-saving solutions* Follow-up: Yes, if affordableConversation 16: Fintech Growth MarketerProfile:* Role: Growth Marketing Lead at fintech startup (payments/crypto)* Experience: 6 years in growth marketing* Manages: $250K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, Google, Twitter, Reddit, TikTokOpening: Rep: "Hey Alex - wait, I'm Alex too. Okay, this is going to be confusing. Anyway, thanks for making time. I'm with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams to understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. Not a sales pitch - just learning. Sound good?"Alex M: "Haha, yeah we're going to have to use last names or something. I'm Alex Martinez, you can call me Martinez. Let's do it - I've got 30 min."Warm-Up: Rep: "Perfect. Give me the rundown on what you're working on."Martinez: "I'm head of growth at a fintech company - we do cross-border payments with crypto rails. Think Venmo but international and blockchain-based. My job is user acquisition, activation, and retention. We're Series B, growing fast, but the market is competitive and ad platforms don't love crypto companies. So it's challenging."Rep: "What's your typical approach?"Martinez: "We run a mix of paid and organic. Paid is mostly Meta, Google, some Twitter and Reddit. Organic is content marketing, referrals, partnerships. We're heavy on testing - probably running 20-30 active experiments at any given time. Growth marketing is all about finding scalable channels and iterating fast."Rep: "What's crushing it right now?"Martinez: "Referrals are our best channel - existing users inviting friends has the lowest CAC and best retention. Meta is profitable but getting expensive. Reddit is interesting - the crypto community is active there and we can get pretty targeted. And content marketing is paying off - we've built SEO momentum and get good organic traffic."Rep: "What's not working?"Martinez: "Google is a nightmare for crypto - our ads get rejected constantly for vague policy reasons. Apple Search Ads won't let us run at all. Traditional display networks are hit or miss. And honestly, retention is hard - people sign up, try it once, then churn. We're constantly fighting that churn."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me more about Google ad rejections. What's happening there?"Martinez: "Google has strict policies around crypto and financial services. Our ads get flagged even though we're fully compliant and licensed. We'll launch a campaign, it runs for a day, then gets suspended. We appeal, wait a week, get reinstated, then it happens again. It's exhausting. We probably spend 10 hours per week just dealing with Google ad policy issues."Rep: "How are you managing that?"Martinez: "We've hired a consultant who specializes in crypto ad policy. We've also diversified away from Google - can't rely on a platform that might shut us down at any moment. But it's frustrating because Google Search has great intent and we'd love to spend more there."Rep: "What's your measurement stack look like?"Martinez: "Pretty sophisticated. We use Segment for data collection, Amplitude for product analytics, Adjust for mobile attribution. Looker for BI. Metabase for some custom stuff. We've built a pretty robust data pipeline. Growth marketing is data-intensive - we're constantly analyzing cohorts, running statistical tests, building models."Rep: "How do you think about payback period and LTV?"Martinez: "We target six-month payback - meaning we want to recoup acquisition costs within six months from transaction fees. LTV is trickier because we're still early and don't have years of data. So we use predictive models based on early engagement - if a user completes three transactions in their first month, they're likely to be high LTV. We optimize for those early actions, not just signups."Rep: "What's your testing philosophy?"Martinez: "Test everything, iterate fast. We run A/B tests on landing pages, ad creative, onboarding flows, pricing, referral incentives - everything. Our product and marketing teams are very experiment-driven. The challenge is coordinating all these tests and making sure we're not polluting results. Like, if marketing is testing new creative while product is testing a new onboarding flow, it's hard to isolate what's driving changes."Rep: "Where do you spend the most manual effort?"Martinez: "Creative production and deployment. We're producing a ton of ad variants - different messaging, different visuals, different formats for each platform. Then manually deploying them, tracking performance, scaling winners. It's operationally heavy. We also spend a lot of time on data analysis - pulling data from multiple sources, stitching it together, building dashboards."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you approaching incrementality measurement?"Martinez: "We run regular geo holdout tests - we'll pause advertising in certain regions and measure the impact on signups. We've learned that maybe 30-40% of our attributed signups would've happened organically anyway. So we're more conservative about scaling spend. We also use tools like GeoLift and Robyn for MMM, though we're still early on that."Rep: "What's your take on platform attribution?"Martinez: "It's directional at best. Meta says they drove X conversions, Google says Y, reality is somewhere in between. We use our own in-house attribution that's based on user journey tracking. But even that has gaps - cross-device tracking is hard, and people delete cookies. So we triangulate - platform data, internal analytics, incrementality tests. No single source of truth."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "What would change the game for you?"Martinez: "Honestly, just less platform policy bullshit. If Google and Apple would let us advertise fairly, we could scale way faster. But beyond that, better creative automation. I want AI to generate and test hundreds of creative variants, find winners, and automatically scale them. We're limited by production capacity."Rep: "What else?"Martinez: "More accurate early LTV prediction. If I could know on Day 1 whether a user will be high-value, I'd optimize so much better. Right now I'm waiting weeks to get LTV data, and by then it's too late to adjust acquisition strategy."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Awesome, super helpful. Platform policy issues, creative production at scale, and early LTV prediction are your main pain points?"Martinez: "Yeah. And honestly, just the general challenge of crypto marketing - we're fighting uphill against platform biases."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're building?"Martinez: "For sure. Growth marketers are always looking for better tools."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Fintech/crypto startup, cross-border payments, Series B* Top 3 Pains: (1) Google ad policy rejections - 10 hrs/week dealing with it, (2) Creative production and deployment at scale (20-30 experiments running), (3) Early LTV prediction accuracy* Tools Used: Meta, Google, Twitter, Reddit, Segment, Amplitude, Adjust, Looker, Metabase* Workarounds: Hired crypto ad policy consultant, geo holdout tests for incrementality, triangulated attribution* Key Quotes: "Diversified away from Google - can't rely on them", "Test everything", "Platform data is directional at best"* Emotional Energy: Analytical and experiment-driven, frustrated by platform limitations* Follow-up: YesConversation 17: Fashion/Apparel Brand MarketerProfile:* Role: Performance Marketing Manager at direct-to-consumer fashion brand* Experience: 5 years in e-commerce/fashion* Manages: $500K monthly ad spend* Platforms: Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Google ShoppingOpening: Rep: "Hey Sophie, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now Ñ what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call Ñ it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"Sophie: "Yeah, totally! I'm always down to talk about what's working in DTC right now. It's a wild space."Warm-Up: Rep: "Love the energy. Tell me about your brand and what you do."Sophie: "We're a sustainable fashion brand - think elevated basics, ethically made. We're DTC-only, about $20M in annual revenue and growing fast. I run all our paid acquisition - Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Google Shopping. My goal is profitable customer acquisition while building brand. Fashion is super competitive, so creative and brand positioning matter a lot."Rep: "What does your day look like?"Sophie: "Mornings I'm checking performance - revenue, ROAS, new customer acquisition. Then I'm in creative reviews - we produce a ton of content and I'm constantly evaluating what's performing. I work closely with our creative team on concepts. Afternoons are campaign optimization and planning. We also do a lot of influencer collabs, so I'm coordinating with our partnerships team. It's a mix of analytical and creative work, which I love."Rep: "What's working really well?"Sophie: "TikTok is fire for us right now - super cheap reach and our content resonates with Gen Z. UGC-style content performs way better than polished brand content. Pinterest is surprisingly strong for consideration - people planning their wardrobes. And our email marketing is killing it - we've really dialed in our flows."Rep: "What's hard?"Sophie: "Creative fatigue is brutal in fashion - an ad that works for two weeks is doing great. Most die in days. So we're constantly producing new content, which is expensive and time-consuming. Also, seasonality and trends - fashion moves fast and we need to react. And honestly, iOS changes hit us hard. Our ROAS dropped like 30% overnight when iOS 14 rolled out."Deep Dive: Rep: "Let's talk about creative fatigue. How are you managing that?"Sophie: "We're basically running a content studio at this point. We shoot new content every two weeks - models, flat lays, UGC-style videos, lifestyle shots. Then we're constantly testing. I probably launch 50+ new ad creatives per week across all platforms. It sounds like a lot, but in fashion, if your creative gets stale, performance craters. We've built a whole system around rapid creative production."Rep: "What does that system look like?"Sophie: "We have an in-house creative team - photographer, videographer, designer. We work with a roster of content creators for UGC. We shoot in batches - like, 'here's our spring collection, let's create 200 assets we can mix and match.' Then I'm deploying those across campaigns, testing, and scaling winners. But even with all that infrastructure, we can barely keep up with creative demand."Rep: "How do you decide what to test?"Sophie: "Mix of data and intuition. Data tells us what's worked historically - certain angles, certain formats. But fashion is trend-driven, so we're also following what's resonating culturally. Like, Y2K aesthetics are huge right now, so we're testing content with that vibe. It's part art, part science."Rep: "What's your approach to measurement?"Sophie: "We look at a few things. ROAS is obvious - did we make more than we spent? But we also track new customer acquisition cost separately because repeat customers are way more valuable. We use Northbeam for attribution - helps us understand cross-channel impact. And we track brand metrics like search volume and social following because DTC is about building brand, not just performance."Rep: "How has iOS 14 changed things for you?"Sophie: "Huge impact. Our Facebook and Instagram performance got way less predictable. Retargeting audiences shrunk. Conversion tracking is messier. We've compensated by going broader with targeting - less granular audiences, more creative-driven. We've also shifted more budget to TikTok and Pinterest because they're less reliant on pixel tracking. And we're investing in first-party data - growing our email list, SMS list, improving our on-site experience."Rep: "What platforms and tools are you using?"Sophie: "Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Google Shopping for paid. Klaviyo for email. Northbeam for attribution. Shopify is our store. We use Canva and Adobe for creative. And honestly, a bunch of influencer management tools for our partnerships. Fashion involves a lot of different tools."Rep: "Where do you feel you're wasting time?"Sophie: "Manually uploading creatives to different platforms. Each platform has different specs - Meta wants 4:5, TikTok wants 9:16, Pinterest wants 2:3. So we're exporting different versions and manually uploading them. That's hours per week. Also, campaign creation is tedious - I'm building similar campaigns in three different ad managers. There should be a way to build once and deploy everywhere."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How do you think about balancing brand building versus direct response?"Sophie: "It's a constant tension. Our CFO wants profitable ROAS every month. But I know we need to invest in brand because that's how DTC brands become sustainable long-term. So we allocate maybe 70% to performance campaigns with clear ROI, and 30% to brand awareness - influencer collabs, upper-funnel content, brand campaigns. The 30% is harder to measure but essential."Rep: "What would better measurement look like?"Sophie: "I'd love to see the long-term impact of brand campaigns. Like, if we run a TikTok brand awareness campaign, how does that affect our organic search volume over the next three months? Or how does influencer content impact our brand consideration? Those connections are currently invisible, but I know they're there."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand, what changes?"Sophie: "Creative workflow automation for sure. I should be able to upload one video, have AI automatically reformat it for every platform's specs, write variations of copy, and deploy everywhere. That would save us 10-15 hours per week. Also, predictive creative testing - AI that tells me which creative concepts will work before I spend money testing them."Rep: "What else would help?"Sophie: "Better attribution that accounts for brand impact. I want to see: this campaign drove sales, but it also increased brand search by X% and grew our Instagram following by Y%. That holistic view would help me make better budget decisions."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This is super helpful. Creative production at scale, cross-platform deployment efficiency, and holistic brand measurement are your key challenges?"Sophie: "Exactly. Fashion is fast and creative-driven, so anything that helps us move faster is gold."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're working on?"Sophie: "100%. I'm always looking for tools that give us an edge."Post-Call Notes:* Company: DTC sustainable fashion brand, $20M revenue* Top 3 Pains: (1) Creative fatigue - need 50+ new assets per week, (2) Manual creative reformatting and platform deployment, (3) Holistic measurement including brand impact* Tools Used: Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Google Shopping, Klaviyo, Northbeam, Shopify, Canva/Adobe* Workarounds: In-house creative studio, batch content production, UGC creator roster* Key Quotes: "Creative gets stale in days", "If creative gets stale, performance craters", "Part art, part science"* Emotional Energy: Energetic, creative-focused, excited about optimization* Follow-up: Yes, very interestedConversation 18: Creator/Influencer Managing Own AdsProfile:* Role: Content creator/influencer running own digital products* Experience: 3 years building audience, 1 year running paid ads* Manages: $10K-20K monthly ad spend (varies)* Platforms: Meta, YouTubeOpening: Rep: "Hey Tyler, thanks for making time. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams to understand how they're running campaigns Ñ what's working, what's painful, where automation could help. This isn't a sales call - just learning from your experience. Sound good?"Tyler: "Yeah, sure. Though I should say up front - I'm not like a 'real' marketer. I'm a creator who happens to run some ads. So my setup is probably pretty basic compared to what you usually hear."Warm-Up: Rep: "That's actually perfect - we want different perspectives. Tell me what you're working on."Tyler: "I'm a YouTube creator in the productivity/business space - about 300K subscribers. I make money from YouTube ads, brand deals, and I sell a course and a Notion template. The ads I run are basically to promote my digital products - drive people to a landing page where they can buy. I'm self-taught on all the marketing stuff, just figuring it out as I go."Rep: "What's your typical process?"Tyler: "Pretty simple. I create content for YouTube organically. Some videos perform really well. So I'll take that video, cut it down into 30-60 second clips, and run them as ads on YouTube and Facebook. The ad drives people to a landing page where they can buy my course or template. If the ad is profitable - meaning I make more than I spend - I keep running it. If not, I turn it off."Rep: "What's working?"Tyler: "YouTube ads perform best because my audience is already on YouTube. They see my ad, recognize my face from my channel, click through. Facebook is more hit or miss. The content that works best is actual value - like, teaching something useful in the ad, then offering the course as a way to learn more. Hard pitches don't work as well."Rep: "What's tough?"Tyler: "Honestly, I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm learning from YouTube tutorials and random blog posts. I don't know if my campaigns are set up optimally. I don't understand all the targeting options. And I'm doing everything myself - creative production, ad setup, landing pages, customer support. It's a lot."Deep Dive: Rep: "Let's dig into the challenges. What feels most confusing?"Tyler: "The ad platforms themselves are overwhelming. There are so many buttons and settings and options. I don't know what half of them do. Like, what's the difference between a conversion campaign and a traffic campaign? When should I use lookalike audiences versus broad targeting? I'm just guessing based on what I've seen other creators do."Rep: "How are you measuring success?"Tyler: "Super basic - I look at how much I spent on ads and how much revenue came in from the landing page. If revenue is higher than ad spend, I'm happy. I use Google Analytics to see how many people visited the landing page from ads. That's about as sophisticated as I get. I know there are probably better ways to track this, but I don't know what they are."Rep: "What's your creative process?"Tyler: "I'm repurposing my YouTube content. I'll take a 15-minute video, pull out the best 60-second clip, add captions, export it, upload to Meta and YouTube ad managers. Then I write ad copy - usually something like 'Want to learn more? Check out my course.' It's not fancy, but it works. The hard part is the editing - reformatting videos for different aspect ratios, adding captions, exporting. That takes a few hours per video."Rep: "How much time do you spend on ads each week?"Tyler: "Maybe 5-10 hours total? A few hours creating ad creatives, an hour or two setting up campaigns, and then checking performance daily. It's not my main thing - I'm primarily focused on content creation. Ads are like a side hustle to monetize my audience better."Rep: "What would make this easier for you?"Tyler: "Templates or presets for campaign setup. Like, 'here's how to set up a course sales campaign' with recommended settings. I'm always worried I'm leaving money on the table because I don't know the optimal way to configure things. Also, better explanations of what everything means - the platforms are so complex and I don't have time to become an expert."Rep: "What about creative production?"Tyler: "If there was a tool that could take my full YouTube video, automatically find the best clips, reformat them for different platforms, add captions, and export - that would save me hours. Right now I'm doing all that manually in Premiere Pro. It's tedious."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could design the perfect system for someone like you - a creator running ads but not a marketer - what would it look like?"Tyler: "Simple and automated. I upload my content, it automatically creates ad variations, sets up campaigns with proven templates, and then just runs. I check a dashboard that shows me: are you making money or losing money? If making money, it automatically scales. If losing money, it pauses. I don't want to think about it - I want to focus on making content."Rep: "Anything else?"Tyler: "Education and support would be huge. Most marketing tools assume you already know what you're doing. For creators like me, we need onboarding, tutorials, support. I'm willing to learn, but I need help."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This is super valuable perspective. Sounds like simplified campaign setup, automated creative production, and more educational resources are what you need?"Tyler: "Yeah, exactly. Tools built for people who aren't professional marketers."Rep: "Would you want to see what we're building, especially if it's designed for creators?"Tyler: "Definitely. If it makes ads easier for non-experts, I'm all ears."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Individual creator, 300K YouTube subscribers, digital products* Top 3 Pains: (1) Campaign setup complexity - doesn't understand all options/settings, (2) Manual creative production - reformatting videos for ads, (3) Need for education and simple explanations* Tools Used: YouTube Ads, Meta Ads, Google Analytics, Premiere Pro* Workarounds: Learning from YouTube tutorials, basic ROI tracking (spend vs revenue)* Key Quotes: "I don't really know what I'm doing", "I'm just guessing", "Tools assume you already know what you're doing"* Emotional Energy: Overwhelmed but willing to learn, focused on content creation over marketing expertise* Follow-up: Yes, especially if creator-focusedConversation 19: Junior Agency Media BuyerProfile:* Role: Media Buyer at mid-size performance marketing agency* Experience: 2 years in digital marketing* Manages: 8 client accounts, ~$400K monthly spend across portfolio* Platforms: Meta, Google, TikTokOpening: Rep: "Hey Jamie, thanks for taking time to chat. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams to understand how they're running campaigns Ñ what's working, what's painful, where automation could help. This isn't a sales call - just learning. That work for you?"Jamie: "Yeah, sounds good. Though heads up - I'm pretty junior, so my perspective might be different from like a director or VP."Warm-Up: Rep: "That's totally fine - we want different perspectives. Tell me about your role."Jamie: "I'm a media buyer at an agency. I manage eight client accounts - mix of e-commerce and lead gen. My day is basically campaign optimization, pulling reports, client calls, and a lot of QA. I'm in the platforms all day - Meta, Google, TikTok - making adjustments, launching new campaigns, checking that everything's running properly."Rep: "What's a typical day like?"Jamie: "Start my morning checking if anything broke overnight - campaigns paused, budgets maxed out, creative rejected. Then I'm going through each client, checking performance against goals, making optimizations. Afternoons are usually reports and internal meetings. Honestly, I'm in like six client calls per week, which is a lot. And I'm always stressed about making mistakes - one wrong bid change can waste thousands of dollars."Rep: "What do you like about the job?"Jamie: "I'm learning a ton. Every client is different - different products, different audiences, different goals. So I'm getting exposure to a lot. And when campaigns work well, it's really satisfying. Like, I just scaled a client from $5K to $20K per month profitably, and they're stoked. That feels good."Rep: "What sucks?"Jamie: "The manual work is brutal. I spend probably 60% of my time doing repetitive tasks - pulling CSVs, copying data into spreadsheets, building reports. It's mind-numbing. Also, the pressure is high - clients expect results and if performance dips, they're emailing. And honestly, I feel like I'm always behind. There's always more I could be testing, more I could be optimizing."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me about the manual work. What are you doing repeatedly?"Jamie: "Every Monday I pull performance data from Meta, Google, TikTok for each client. That's 24 exports. Then I'm copying the data into our reporting template - we have a Google Sheet for each client. Then I'm calculating week-over-week changes, adding notes on what changed and why. Then I'm turning that into a client-facing deck. For eight clients, that's my entire Monday. Sometimes Tuesday too if clients are demanding."Rep: "That sounds exhausting. What have you tried to streamline it?"Jamie: "We use Supermetrics to auto-pull some data, but it's limited. We've tried templating our reports, but every client wants it slightly different. So we're still customizing manually. I've asked my manager if we can get better tools, but the agency is cheap. They'd rather hire junior people like me to do manual work than pay for expensive software."Rep: "Walk me through a recent stressful situation."Jamie: "Last month, I was launching a big campaign for a client - $10K budget. I set up the campaigns in Meta, everything looked good, hit launch. Next morning I check and we'd spent $6K overnight. I forgot to set a daily budget cap - just a total budget. The campaign burned through 60% of the monthly budget in one night. I panicked, paused everything, had to tell my manager. Client was pissed. It was a mistake that could've been caught with better QA, but I was moving too fast."Rep: "How did that situation resolve?"Jamie: "Manager helped me smooth it over with the client. We shifted budget from later in the month to cover it. But it was a wake-up call that I need to slow down and double-check everything. The problem is I'm managing so many accounts that it's hard to give each one the attention it needs. I'm constantly context-switching."Rep: "What tools do you wish you had?"Jamie: "Something that automates reporting entirely. Like, I should be able to click a button and reports generate automatically for all clients. Also, better alerting - if something's going wrong, I want to know immediately, not when I happen to check. And honestly, templates for common campaign types. I'm rebuilding similar campaigns over and over. There should be presets."Rep: "How much do you learn from senior people at the agency?"Jamie: "Not as much as I'd like. My manager is stretched thin and doesn't have time to mentor. So I'm learning from Google, YouTube, Reddit. Sometimes I make mistakes because I didn't know best practices. I wish there was more structure around training and development."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could redesign your workflow, what changes?"Jamie: "Eliminate all the manual reporting. Automate campaign QA - like, flag potential issues before I hit launch. And honestly, give me better tools so I can focus on strategy instead of data entry. I didn't get into marketing to copy-paste CSVs. I want to actually think about what will drive results for clients."Rep: "Where do you see yourself in a few years?"Jamie: "Hopefully senior media buyer or manager. But I'm worried I'm not developing the right skills. I'm becoming really good at manual work and firefighting, but not as good at strategic thinking. If I could spend more time testing and less time reporting, I'd grow faster in my career."Wrap-Up: Rep: "Super helpful to hear the junior perspective. Sounds like automated reporting, better QA/alerting, and campaign templates are your main needs?"Jamie: "Yeah. And honestly, just feeling less overwhelmed. I want to do good work, but I'm drowning in busy work."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing what we build?"Jamie: "For sure. Though my manager makes tool decisions, not me. But I can advocate for it."Post-Call Notes:* Company: Mid-size agency, junior media buyer, 8 clients, $400K monthly spend* Top 3 Pains: (1) Manual reporting - 60% of time on repetitive tasks, (2) Campaign QA and mistake prevention, (3) Context-switching across 8 clients with limited attention for each* Tools Used: Meta, Google, TikTok, Supermetrics, Google Sheets* Workarounds: Manual data exports every Monday, custom reports for each client* Key Quotes: "I'm drowning in busy work", "Always stressed about making mistakes", "Learning from Google and YouTube"* Emotional Energy: Overwhelmed, eager to learn, frustrated by manual work* Follow-up: Yes, but decision-maker is managerConversation 20: Marketing Operations/Technical MarketerProfile:* Role: Marketing Operations Manager at SaaS company* Experience: 7 years in marketing operations* Manages: Not directly managing ad spend, but supports team that manages $300K monthly* Platforms: All platforms via integrations/APIsOpening: Rep: "Hey Raj, thanks for making time. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams to understand how they're running campaigns Ñ what's working, what's painful, where automation could help. This isn't a sales call - just learning. Sound good?"Raj: "Yeah, though I should clarify - I don't actually run campaigns. I'm marketing ops, so I build the infrastructure and systems that the campaign teams use. Different angle, but happy to share."Warm-Up: Rep: "Actually, that's a really valuable perspective. Tell me about your role."Raj: "I'm the marketing ops manager. My job is owning our marketing tech stack, data infrastructure, and automation. So I'm managing integrations between our ad platforms, CRM, data warehouse, BI tools. I build dashboards, set up tracking, automate data flows. The campaign team focuses on creative and strategy - I make sure they have the data and tools they need."Rep: "What's your day like?"Raj: "Mix of firefighting and building. Firefighting is when something breaks - an integration stops working, data isn't flowing, a report is showing wrong numbers. Building is when I'm implementing new tools, creating new dashboards, optimizing our data pipeline. I'm also in a lot of meetings - requirements gathering with campaign team, vendor calls, IT coordination. It's very cross-functional."Rep: "What's going well?"Raj: "We've built a pretty solid data infrastructure over the last two years. We have all our marketing data flowing into Snowflake, then into Looker for dashboards. The campaign team can self-serve most of their reporting needs. We've also automated a lot of manual work - like, lead scoring is now automated, campaign tagging is automated. It's way more mature than when I started."Rep: "What's tough?"Raj: "Constant vendor changes. Ad platforms change their APIs, tools deprecate features, integrations break. I spend probably 30% of my time just maintaining existing systems. Also, the campaign team always wants more - new data sources, new metrics, new dashboards. There's always a backlog. And honestly, data quality is an ongoing battle - garbage in, garbage out."Deep Dive: Rep: "Tell me about data quality issues. What does that look like?"Raj: "Lots of things. UTM parameters not being used consistently - someone on the team launches a campaign without proper tagging, and now we can't attribute it. Conversion tracking breaks - maybe a pixel stops firing, or server-side tracking has an issue. Duplicate records in our CRM from form fills. Discrepancies between platform reporting and our internal reporting. I'm constantly doing data hygiene - cleaning up, standardizing, fixing gaps."Rep: "How do you handle integration maintenance?"Raj: "We use tools like Fivetran and Segment for some data pipelines, which helps. But we also have custom scripts and API calls I wrote that require maintenance. When a platform changes their API, I need to update our code. Sometimes platforms sunset features entirely and we need to rebuild. It's like technical debt - always there, always growing."Rep: "What's your tech stack look like?"Raj: "Pretty extensive. Ad platforms obviously - Meta, Google, LinkedIn. Salesforce is our CRM. Marketo for marketing automation. Segment for data collection. Snowflake for data warehouse. Looker for BI. We use Zapier for some lightweight automations. And a bunch of smaller tools - call tracking, form tracking, attribution. Probably 20+ marketing tools total."Rep: "How do you evaluate new tools?"Raj: "Pretty rigorous process. I need to see: does it solve a real problem, does it integrate with our stack, is the pricing reasonable, is their support good. I do proof-of-concepts before committing. And I involve stakeholders - if the campaign team won't actually use it, it doesn't matter how good it is technically. I've seen too many tools get bought and then abandoned."Rep: "What's the biggest challenge in your role?"Raj: "Balancing innovation with stability. The campaign team wants new capabilities - 'can we track this?' 'can we integrate with that tool?' But every new thing I add increases complexity and maintenance burden. So I'm constantly making trade-offs - will this new thing provide enough value to justify the ongoing maintenance cost? Sometimes the answer is no, and the team is frustrated."Rep: "Where do you spend the most time?"Raj: "Dashboard and report building. Everyone wants custom dashboards - sales wants a dashboard, marketing wants a dashboard, executives want a dashboard, each with different cuts of the data. I'm probably spending 15-20 hours per week just building and maintaining dashboards. The other big time sink is troubleshooting - figuring out why data looks wrong, why an integration failed, why numbers don't match."Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How do you approach attribution from a technical standpoint?"Raj: "We've built a multi-touch attribution model in Snowflake. We capture all touchpoints - ad clicks, website visits, email opens, form fills - and store them with timestamps. Then we apply attribution logic - linear, time-decay, position-based, whatever the marketing team wants. The hard part is connecting touchpoints across devices and sessions. We use probabilistic matching, but it's not perfect."Rep: "What's your take on incrementality measurement?"Raj: "We've done a few geo holdout tests, but it's operationally complex. Requires coordinating with the campaign team, making sure they don't accidentally advertise in holdout regions, running statistical analysis. It's high-effort. I'd love to have a more systematic incrementality testing framework, but we don't have the resources to build it."Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could snap your fingers and fix one thing, what would it be?"Raj: "Standardized data schemas and APIs across platforms. Every platform calls things something different, stores data differently, has different API quirks. So much of my time goes to translating between platforms. If there were industry standards, my life would be so much easier."Rep: "What else?"Raj: "Better data quality enforcement. I want tools that prevent bad data from getting into our systems in the first place. Like, if someone tries to launch a campaign without proper UTM tags, the system blocks them. Or if a pixel isn't firing, I get alerted immediately instead of finding out weeks later."Rep: "Where do you see marketing ops heading?"Raj: "More automation, more AI. A lot of what I do manually - data cleaning, dashboard building, troubleshooting - could probably be automated or AI-assisted. The role should shift from manual execution to strategic thinking about data architecture and measurement."Wrap-Up: Rep: "This has been really insightful. Sounds like integration maintenance overhead, data quality enforcement, and dashboard/report building are your main pain points?"Raj: "Exactly. Marketing ops is all about enabling the team, but we spend too much time on infrastructure maintenance."Rep: "Would you be interested in seeing what we're building?"Raj: "For sure. I evaluate marketing tools all the time, so always happy to look at new solutions."Post-Call Notes:* Company: SaaS company, marketing ops role, supports $300K monthly spend* Top 3 Pains: (1) Integration maintenance - APIs changing, 30% of time on upkeep, (2) Data quality enforcement - UTM tagging inconsistencies, tracking breaks, (3) Custom dashboard/report building - 15-20 hrs/week* Tools Used: Meta, Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce, Marketo, Segment, Snowflake, Looker, Fivetran, Zapier* Workarounds: Custom scripts for API maintenance, manual data hygiene, probabilistic cross-device matching* Key Quotes: "Constant vendor changes", "Garbage in, garbage out", "Balancing innovation with stability"* Emotional Energy: Technical and systematic, frustrated by lack of standardization* Follow-up: Yes, actively evaluates tools
