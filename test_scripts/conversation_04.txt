Opening: Rep: "Hey Rachel, thanks so much for taking the time today. I'm Alex with the Marin team at Gauntlet. We're doing a round of short conversations with marketing teams and agencies to really understand how they're running campaigns right now  what's working, what's painful, and where automation could make life easier. This isn't a sales call  it's more of a discovery session so we can learn from your experience. Does that sound good?"
Rachel: "Sure, though I'll mention upfront that enterprise marketing operates pretty differently from what you might see at smaller companies. Lots of stakeholders, complex approval processes, legacy systems."
Warm-Up: Rep: "Awesome. To start, could you tell me a bit about your business and what your role looks like day-to-day?"
Rachel: "We're a major retail brand with both physical stores and e-commerce. I oversee all digital performance marketing - search, social, display, Amazon advertising. I have a team of 12 split across channel specialists, an analytics team, and creative producers. My day-to-day is mostly strategic - reviewing performance dashboards, meeting with my team leads, stakeholder presentations, budget planning, and working with our agency partners on larger initiatives."
Rep: "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"
Rachel: "Mondays are team sync meetings - each channel lead presents their performance and plans. Tuesdays I'm usually in cross-functional meetings - merchandising, finance, IT, brand team. Wednesdays are agency meetings - we work with three different agencies for different channels. Thursdays are analysis and planning days. Fridays are executive presentations or planning sessions. I'm probably in meetings 25-30 hours per week, which is too much but typical for enterprise."
Rep: "What's been going really well lately?"
Rachel: "Our omnichannel approach is finally coming together - we can see when digital ads drive store visits. Amazon is growing fast and profitable. Our Google Shopping campaigns are extremely efficient because of all the product feed work we've done. And we've actually gotten pretty good at moving fast for a large company - we can launch campaigns in days instead of weeks now."
Rep: "And on the flip side, what's been harder than expected?"
Rachel: "Privacy changes have been brutal. Our retargeting audiences are a fraction of what they were two years ago. Getting different systems to talk to each other is a constant battle - our POS system, e-commerce platform, ad platforms, data warehouse. And honestly, organizational complexity slows everything down. Simple decisions require five layers of approval. Our tech stack is also a Frankenstein monster - we have legacy systems that are 15 years old running alongside new tools."
Deep Dive: Rep: "What are your biggest challenges when running ad campaigns right now?"
Rachel: "I'd say three major areas. First, data infrastructure and integration. We have data everywhere but it's siloed - ad platform data, website analytics, in-store data, CRM data. Getting a unified view is really hard. Second, organizational agility. We're competing with digitally native brands that move 10x faster than us. By the time we get approval for a campaign, the moment has passed. Third, attribution in an omnichannel world. We need to understand how paid search impacts store visits, how social ads influence Amazon purchases, how display builds brand awareness that converts later through organic channels. It's complex."
Rep: "Walk me through a recent campaign that was tough or frustrating  what happened?"
Rachel: "We wanted to launch a campaign around a competitor's product recall - we had a competitive advantage and wanted to capitalize quickly. Our team identified the opportunity on a Monday. By the time we got through legal review, brand approval, creative development, media planning, and all the sign-offs, it was three weeks later and the news cycle had moved on. We launched the campaign but it was too late - the moment had passed. That's the frustration of enterprise - we have all the resources but can't move fast enough."
Rep: "When something goes wrong, where does it usually happen?"
Rachel: "Usually at integration points between systems. Like, our inventory system doesn't update fast enough, so we advertise products that are out of stock. Or our CRM data doesn't sync properly with ad platforms, so customer match audiences are stale. Or different teams use different tracking parameters, so attribution gets messy. We have a lot of technical debt from years of bolting on new systems without proper integration planning."
Rep: "How do you onboard new campaigns? What's that process like from start to finish?"
Rachel: "It's pretty formalized. First, we develop the campaign brief - objectives, target audience, messaging, budget. That goes through stakeholder review. Then we work with creative teams on assets - 2-3 weeks for production. Then campaign buildout across platforms - our team or agencies handle this. QA process - we have a checklist of like 40 items. Legal and compliance review - another week usually. Then launch and monitoring. End to end, major campaigns take 6-8 weeks from concept to launch. Smaller campaigns we can turn around in 2-3 weeks."
Rep: "Do you mostly configure and let things run, or do you have to stay hands-on daily?"
Rachel: "Mix of both. We have automation handling a lot of the optimization - Google Smart Bidding, Meta's Advantage+, our DSP algorithms. But my team monitors daily because at our scale, small issues become big problems fast. Like, if an automated system makes a bidding mistake and we overspend by 10%, that's potentially $30K-40K in a single day. So we have humans in the loop checking everything."
Rep: "What tools or platforms are you using today?"
Rachel: "Ad platforms - Google Ads, Meta, Amazon Advertising, The Trade Desk, Criteo, Pinterest. Analytics - Google Analytics 360, Adobe Analytics. BI and data - Tableau, our data warehouse built on Snowflake. Attribution - we have a marketing mix modeling partner. CRM - Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Creative - Adobe Creative Suite. Project management - Jira, Monday.com. We probably have 30+ marketing tools in our stack."
Rep: "What do you love about them? What's frustrating?"
Rachel: "Love: We have best-in-class tools for everything. Google Analytics 360 is powerful. Adobe Analytics lets us do deep analysis. The Trade Desk gives us great programmatic control. Frustrating: Nothing talks to each other properly. We spend more time on data engineering than marketing. Every tool has its own dashboard, its own definitions, its own way of doing things. We've tried to build unified dashboards but it's constantly breaking because APIs change or data schemas shift. And the cost - we spend millions on marketing technology, which eats into our media budget."
Rep: "Where do you feel automation breaks down or still needs humans?"
Rachel: "Strategic decisions and creative intuition. Automation can optimize to a KPI, but it can't understand brand strategy or competitive positioning. It can't tell you that we should invest in a new channel before the data proves it out. It also can't handle exceptions - like when there's a PR crisis and we need to pause all advertising immediately, or when supply chain issues mean we need to stop advertising certain products. And automation definitely can't navigate organizational politics, which is half my job."
Rep: "How much time does your team spend on manual reporting or data reconciliation?"
Rachel: "Way too much. I'd estimate 30-40% of my analytics team's time is spent on data wrangling - pulling data from different sources, reconciling discrepancies, formatting reports for different audiences. We probably dedicate 2-3 full-time people just to reporting. It's ridiculous when you think about it - we have millions in technology, but we still need humans to manually compile data."
Rep: "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with that time?"
Rachel: "Deep analysis and testing. We do a lot of reporting but not enough insight generation. I'd love my team to spend time understanding why things work, not just what happened. More competitive analysis. More customer research. More experimentation with new channels and tactics. Right now, we're so busy keeping the lights on that we don't have time for innovation."
Strategy + Measurement: Rep: "How are you thinking about incrementality, attribution, and MMM right now?"
Rachel: "We do all three. We run geo holdout tests quarterly to measure incrementality - essential at our scale. We have a multi-touch attribution model, though we take it with a grain of salt. And we invest in marketing mix modeling annually with an external partner. The reality is that no single measurement approach is perfect, so we triangulate. If all three methods tell us search is working well, we trust that. Where they disagree, we dig deeper."
Rep: "Since cookies dropped, what's changed in your retargeting performance?"
Rachel: "Significant impact. Our retargeting audiences are maybe 60% of what they were pre-iOS 14. CPMs have gone up because everyone's bidding on smaller audiences. We've had to shift strategy - less granular retargeting, more contextual targeting, more first-party data activation. We're also investing heavily in our CRM and loyalty program to build first-party relationships. It's a multi-year strategic shift for us."
Rep: "Are you experimenting with first-party data approaches?"
Rachel: "Heavily. We're uploading customer lists to all platforms for customer match targeting. We're using our loyalty program data to build lookalike audiences. We're implementing server-side tracking across our properties. We just launched a clean room partnership with a retail media network. First-party data is now a competitive advantage - we have millions of customers, which gives us scale that smaller brands don't have."
Rep: "What's your biggest headache when it comes to data compliance or stakeholder reporting?"
Rachel: "Compliance is actually pretty manageable - we have legal and privacy teams handling that. Stakeholder reporting is the real headache. Every executive wants different things. CFO wants CAC and payback period. CMO wants brand lift and engagement metrics. CEO wants top-line revenue impact. Head of stores wants to see store visit lift. Merchandising wants category-level performance. I'm creating five different reports for five different audiences. And they all want it in different formats on different schedules."
Rep: "How easy is it for stakeholders to interpret the data you provide?"
Rachel: "It's gotten better, but there's still confusion. Executives don't always understand the nuances of attribution or why different channels have different success metrics. We spend a lot of time in meetings explaining the numbers. I've started including 'so what' sections in every report - here's what the data means, here's what we're doing about it. But data literacy at the executive level is still a challenge."
Vision & Desired Future: Rep: "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"
Rachel: "Unified data infrastructure. I want one source of truth where all our marketing data lives, properly integrated, with consistent definitions and metrics. We waste so much time and money on duct-taping systems together. If we had a proper marketing data platform that everything connected to, it would transform how we operate."
Rep: "What would an ideal system look like for you?"
Rachel: "Enterprise-grade but flexible. Something that can handle our scale - billions in revenue, millions of customers, hundreds of campaigns - but still let us move fast. Real-time data across all channels. Smart automation that understands business rules and constraints. And critically, something that works with our legacy systems without requiring us to rip and replace everything. We can't do a big bang migration - we need tools that meet us where we are."
Rep: "What's one thing that would make you look like a hero internally?"
Rachel: "If I could demonstrate that our performance marketing directly drives profitable growth at scale. Right now, there's always doubt - are we just getting credit for sales that would've happened anyway? If I could prove incrementality clearly and show a path to scaling profitably, that would be game-changing. Or if I could somehow cut our reporting time by 50% and redeploy those resources to growth initiatives."
Rep: "Where do you think the biggest opportunities for automation or AI could be?"
Rachel: "Three areas. One, automated data integration and reconciliation - AI should be able to pull data from different sources, identify the same customer across platforms, and give us unified reporting. Two, predictive budget allocation - AI should look at all our historical data and tell us how to allocate next quarter's budget for maximum ROI. Three, automated creative optimization - we have thousands of products, AI should be able to generate and test creative variants at scale. We're too big to do everything manually but too complex for simple automation."
Wrap-Up: Rep: "That's super helpful  thank you for walking me through all that. Just to recap, I heard that unified data infrastructure, organizational agility, and omnichannel attribution are your top three pains. Did I get that right?"
Rachel: "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, just managing the complexity of enterprise at scale."
Rep: "We're compiling insights from these conversations to shape some early prototypes. Would you be open to us showing you what we're working on when it's ready?"
Rachel: "Sure, though fair warning - enterprise sales cycles are long and you'll need to talk to procurement, security, IT, and like five other teams. But yes, I'm interested in seeing what you build."
